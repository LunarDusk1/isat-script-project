<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> How did you know the little girl had a familytale?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (TS_fake1b):</b> "I figured I should ask."</p>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You already failed this one, didn't you.)</i></p>

<p><i>(She always figures out something is wrong, when you're not careful.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Stay silent.)</i></p>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> ...Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> I don't mind secrets, Siffrin. I have many of my own. If you want to keep yours... That's fine.</p>
<p><b>Odile (serious2):</b> But what I hate... Is when those secrets are about me, and when people I consider friends keep them from me.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (TS_dismissive2):</b> "So we're friends, now?"</p>
