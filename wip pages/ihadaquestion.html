<p>"At the end, Isabeau..."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Ah, the thing he said he'd tell you at the end of your journey?
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> He mentions he wants to tell you something, when you go and sleep at the Clocktower... That's probably it.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> But someone interrupted him just as he was about to tell you! How unfortunate!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> If only there was a way to make sure he wouldn't be interrupted, maybe you'd finally get to hear what he has to say...</p>

<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> ...Pft... Yeah...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> HAHAHAHAHA!!! Yeah!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> Your Fighter... He was about to tell you, without being interrupted, and you had to ruin it yourself!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> How nice of him, to stop himself from saying it because you looked upset!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> But you just really wanted him to tell you!!! Even though you know!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> Because you know what he wants to tell you, don't you? You can be dense sometimes, but you're not THAT dense!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> ...Teehee, ooooh, you're so angry! I can see it in your face!</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> Who are you angry at? At me??? But I'm just telling the truth, stardust~!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(And laughing about it.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Because it's just too funny, stardust!!! A blinding tragedy, and there's nothing you can do to change it!!!</p>

<p>"Bonnie was looking at a book...."</p>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> They were, weren't they?</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> A book with a scary figurine on it... They acted very defensive when they saw you'd noticed.</p>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> They were looking at a book about burial rituals, because you all talked about what you'd all do if you died.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> No wonder the Kid was upset about it.</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...I'm glad that you got the courage to talk to them about it. It seems like it helped you both.</p>
