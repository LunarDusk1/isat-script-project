<h2 id="bonnieside1">Start</h2>
<p><i>Unlocks the question after Bonnie picks up the book on the third floor Writing Room (aka the right side dead end past the tears).</i></p>

<br>

<p>"Bonnie was looking at a book...."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> They were, weren't they?</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> A book with a scary figurine on it... They acted very defensive when they saw you'd noticed.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> But... Who cares? Is it that important to find out?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Something about it worries you.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Since Bonnie takes the book away before you can read it, you wonder if you could find that book elsewhere...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="bonnieside2">Siffrin finds a second book</h2>
<p><i>Unlocked after Siffrin finds a copy of the book in the Floor 1 Break Room.</i></p>

<br>

<p>"Bonnie was looking at a book...."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> They were... And you found a copy of that book elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> "Life To Ashes: Death Rituals From Around the World"...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> Why would... Why would they look at this book? What would make them interested in this...?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You think you know the exact moment that made them think about this.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="bonnieside3">Bonnie yells at Siffrin</h2>
<p><i>Unlocked after redoing the second snack break and having a preteen yell at Siffrin. You can't advance past this point if you've never done Bonnie's Friendquest.</i></p>

<br>

<p>"Bonnie was looking at a book...."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> They were looking at a book about burial rituals, because you all talked about what you'd all do if you died.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> No wonder the Kid was upset about it.</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake2):</b> Pretty stupid of you adults to talk about that stuff where they could hear you!</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> No wonder the kid hates you!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> And?</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Will you do something about it? Talk to your Kid about it after, maybe?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>If you haven't done Bonnie's Friendquest:</h4>
<p><i>(You can't, you can't, you can't even think about it.)</i></p>

<h4>If you have:</h4>
<p><i>(You should.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="bonnieside4">Ending</h2>
<p><i>Wrap up conversation after receiving Memory of Promise.</i></p>

<br>

<p>"Bonnie was looking at a book...."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> They were! A book about burial rituals, because you adults all talked about your death.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> Kids shouldn't be worrying about things like this... What a world we live in.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...I'm glad that you got the courage to talk to them about it. It seems like it helped you both.</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> And... You made a promise, didn't you?</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Try to keep it!</p>

<br>

<h2 id="confess1">After Isabeau's first failed confession</h2>

<p>"At the end, Isabeau..."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Ah, the thing he said he'd tell you at the end of your journey?
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> He mentions he wants to tell you something, when you go and sleep at the Clocktower... That's probably it.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> But someone interrupted him just as he was about to tell you! How unfortunate!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> If only there was a way to make sure he wouldn't be interrupted, maybe you'd finally get to hear what he has to say...</p>


<br>

<h4>Before distracting Bonnie for the first time:</h4>
<p><i>(If you talked to Bonnie beforehand, maybe...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>After multiple interruptions:</h4>
<p><i>(And it keeps happening, too.)</i></p>

<h2 id="confess2">After the "confession" proper</h2>

<p>"At the end, Isabeau..."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> ...Pft... Yeah...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> HAHAHAHAHA!!! Yeah!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> Your Fighter... He was about to tell you, without being interrupted, and you had to ruin it yourself!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> How nice of him, to stop himself from saying it because you looked upset!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> But you just really wanted him to tell you!!! Even though you know!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> Because you know what he wants to tell you, don't you? You can be dense sometimes, but you're not THAT dense!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> ...Teehee, ooooh, you're so angry! I can see it in your face!</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> Who are you angry at? At me??? But I'm just telling the truth, stardust~!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(And laughing about it.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Because it's just too funny, stardust!!! A blinding tragedy, and there's nothing you can do to change it!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Hahahahahahahaha!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You want to stop talking about this.)</i></p>
