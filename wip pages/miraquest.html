<p><i>(You need help on how to...)</i></p>
<p>"...help everyone."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Hm, well...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy3):</b> Sounds like your Housemaiden wanted to talk to you, didn't she? You might as well talk to her this loop, before you forget.</p>

<br>

<h1 id="mira1">First Talk with Mirabelle</h1>
<p><i>For everything leading up to this, see <a href="/acts/act3-4/intro3.html">ACT 3 Intro</a>. This is part of the intro to the entire Friendquest storyline.</i></p>
<p><b>Full page:</b> <a href="/rooms/dormont/miratalk.html">Mirabelle Beginning Talk</a></p>

<br>

<p><i>(Mirabelle is here, sitting on a bench and looking at papers.)</i></p>
<p><i>(She wanted to talk to you, didn't she...?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Oh! Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Um, sorry to bother you while you're so busy, but I REALLY wanted to make sure you were okay...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> You... You'd tell me if anything was wrong, right?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(Where is THIS coming from...)</i> "Of course I'd tell you!"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Siffrin, I...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (serious1):</b> I'm&nbsp; not sure you're telling me the truth here.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (serious2):</b> I don't want to force you to do anything, but you have to know I want you to be happy.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> And I know this is a stressful moment for all of us, but the only way we can get through this is if we talk to each other! If we share our worries!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> S-So, um, I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you need help with anything...!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> I-If you need help with anything, I'm, I'm here for you!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Hm...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Hm, okay, weird.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Why is she telling you this...?)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Ah, you know why she's asking you this.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Poor Mirabelle can't just say it, so you'll have to do it for her...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (fufu1):</b> <i>(Clearly what's happening is...)</i> "Do YOU need help with something?"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> Huh? HUH? HUH?!?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> NO! That's not why I'm--URGH!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Mirabelle urgh'd at you.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (hmf1):</b> Sigh. You can be such an oblivious person sometimes. Anyway, I--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(AND she sigehd! And called you names! Who is this!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (serious5):</b> --don't need help. Not at all.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> <i>(Okay now that's a lie.)</i> "Not even with those papers of yours?"</p>

<br>

<p><i>(She's been looking at those for every loop you've been in. Clearly there's something wrong with them.)</i>
<p><i>(You poke the papers to make your point.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> HUH?!? NO! NOT AT ALL!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> Do not look at the papers, the papers are irrelevant, do NOT LOOK AT THEM SIFFRIN I SEE YOU LOOKING AT THEM</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You arch an eyebrow, smiling.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> Urgh!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (hmf1):</b> Alright, YES the papers are giving me a lot of trouble and I hate them.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1):</b> But I'm only looking at them now to get worried at something other than, um, tomorrow? They aren't that big of a deal.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> If I have to be worried I'd rather be worried about the thing that won't kill me.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1):</b> There's even more in my dorm room in the House... Those stupid papers have been following me since before the King stuff even started...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(There's more in her dorm room...? The one on Floor 3?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> So... If we're done talking about my papers...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> If there's nothing I can do for you, Siffrin...?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "Nah, I'm good."</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> Sigh...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (worried1):</b> I'll see you later, then...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Sounds like you could help Mirabelle with her problems if you went snooping a bit...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...If she needs help, maybe everyone else does too?)</i></p>
<p><i>(You should ask everyone and see if you can help them with anything.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Talking to her again before finding the papers</h2>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "Can I help you with anything?"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (hm1):</b> Help? Me? With anything?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(She hugs the papers she was looking at closer to her.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> I, um. Do not need help with anything. And definitely not those papers.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Sounds like you need to figure out what those papers are.)</i></p>
<p><i>(She said she had more in her dorm room in the House, didnt she?)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="loop2">Loop Talk 2</h1>

<p><b>Siffrin (neutral1):</b> <i>(You need help on how to...)</i> "...help everyone."</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Which one, stardust?</p>
<p><b>ACT 3: Siffrin (neutral1):</b> <i>(Which ally...)</i> "Mirabelle."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> So your Housemaiden is hiding something? Some papers?</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> She implied at the time that she has more of those papers somewhere in her dorm... Maybe you should go and take a look!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> Be careful, though! She might be watching you closely, since that's her room. You might have to be sneaky about it!</p>

<br>

<h1 id="miradorm">Mirabelle's Dorm Room</h1>

<h1 id="loop3">Loop Talk 3</h1>

<p><b>Siffrin (neutral1):</b> <i>(You need help on how to...)</i> "...help everyone."</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Which one, stardust?</p>
<p><b>ACT 3: Siffrin (neutral1):</b> <i>(Which ally...)</i> "Mirabelle."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol2):</b> You found some papers in your Housemaiden's room! The same as the ones she's always reading in Dormont! Mystery solved!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Well, not really solved. They looked like files about different people, didn't they?</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> Each file was about a different person, answering some questions like "where do you see yourself in ten years?" or whatever... I wonder what that's about?</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> You should go back to Dormont and ask her about it!</p>

<p><i>(Mirabelle is here, sitting on a bench and looking at papers.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Hi Siffrin! Do you need anything?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (questions1):</b> <i>(Questions...)</i> "So, which one will you choose?"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy3):</b> Hm? Sorry?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You point at her pile of papers.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy3):</b> Wha--</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Had a nice time talking with your Housemaiden?</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> So... She feels bad, because she can't love people romantically, and she feels like she can't do what's needed of her, as a Housemaiden...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> She feels like she can't change in the way that's asked of her, since she doesn't want to get in a relationship, ever.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> Must be hard. Having a crisis of faith like this.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...Sounds like talking to you helped her, though.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> And talking to her didn't help you, but it made her stronger, which is all you can ask for, huh?</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> Don't forget! If you want her to get that special skill again, you'll have to hang out with her once more.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> Or, well, you could do it and zone out the whole time if you wanted to. But that's cheating!</p>
