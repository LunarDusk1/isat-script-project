<h1 id="first">Talking to her first</h1>
<p><i>Dialogue when talking to Euphrasie before you've finished talking to everybody else. You only get new dialogue the first time you try to talk to her in any given loop. Subsequent times in the same loop, she boots straight to generic dialogue. TLDR: it takes five loops to get all of this dialogue.</i></p>
<p><i>There's variables for repeating these, but I'm not sure you can? I haven't included them, as they might not get called at all... I'd need to experiment more.</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Start</h2>
<p><i>This dialogue always occurs, no matter how often it's been. At the end of this is when Siffrin's responses change for new dialogue. Imagine this bit in front of all the other dialogues.</i></p>
<p><i>The very first time you talk to her, there's no additional dialogue after this.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling3):</b> Oh, traveling one... Siffrin, was it?</p>
<p><b>Euprhasie (smiling1):</b> I cannot thank you enough for what you've done.</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (thankyou1):</b> I'm sure you and your companions have a lot to talk about... Why don't you talk to them, and come back to me?</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling4):</b> I'd love to have a conversation with one of Vaugarde's saviors, after all!</p>

<br>

<h2>Second time</h2>
<p><b>Siffrin (what1):</b> "But I'd like to talk to you now--"</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (sorry1):</b> Now? But you and your friends had such a wonderful journey together!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling3):</b> And it's about to end! You should go and talk to them!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling1):</b> Don't worry about me! I'll be right here for when you're done talking to them!</p>

<br>

<h2>Third time</h2>
<p><b>Siffrin (what1):</b> "I have to talk to you about--"</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling3):</b> Tut tut tut!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling1):</b> This can wait, can't it? I'm sure you and your friends have a lot to talk about, and so little time left to do so!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling4):</b> Go on, go on!</p>

<br>

<h2>Fourth time</h2>
<p><b>Siffrin (tired2):</b> "But you might know something about--"</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling4):</b> Ohohoho!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling4):</b> Sorry, I know nothing until you talk to your friends!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling3):</b> And quite honestly, it is a little funny to see you get steamed about this, ohoho!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You want to cry.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Fifth time</h2>
<p><b>Siffrin (tired1):</b> "Can you PLEASE talk to me?</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (sorry3):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (thankyou1):</b> Traveling one... Siffrin... Can't you feel it?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Huh?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Euphrasie (thankyou1):</b> If you talk to me... REALLY talk to me...</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (sorry1):</b> It's all over.</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (sorry2):</b> What "it" is, I have no idea...</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (sorry1):</b> I know... I can feel that... I couldn't change whatever comes next, even if I wanted to.</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling3):</b> But I know it is the will of the Change God.</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (sorry3):</b> Or, no, perhaps... The will of something even bigger...</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (sorry2):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (thankyou1):</b> Something will end, once you talk to me.</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling3):</b> But before this "something" ends... Don't you want to talk to your companions?</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling1):</b> So go! Go! Go and talk to everyone!!!</p>

<br>

<h2>Sixth time onward</h2>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Generic</h2>
<p><i>When you talk to her a second time (or more) in one loop.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling1):</b> Go on and talk to your companions!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling4):</b> I shall wait right in this very spot!
