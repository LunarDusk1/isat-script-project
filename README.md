# isat-script-project

Hi! Welcome to the isat script project, wherein I'm trying to make a full script of the video game In Stars and Time!

This github account serves to allow collaboration on the neocities page (felicitations.neocities.org). It was set up with extensive help from goldstarglowww. 

Changes made to the main branch will automatically reflect to the neocities page!

When creating or updating a page, please remember to:

- follow appropriate HTML formatting practises. Compare with other pages for reference. Please use the file 1template.html to base a page off of.
- Update the Index (index.html) in the "New Events" section with a link to the appropriate page.
- Update the RSS feed (feed.txt) with a link and short blurb of the page.

I (felikatze) reserve the right to veto any changes, because this site is my baby. Thank you!
