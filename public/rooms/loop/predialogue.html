<h1>Loop Pre-Dialogue</h1>
<p>WIP note: reformat to new standard.</p>
<p>A list of chats initiated by Loop, before you're able to select anything.</p>
<p>This was created together with bibliomaniac and codacheetah!</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> Common Event 0162 (PreDialogue)</p>

<h2>Types</h2>
<p>Loop's conversations are sorted by priority. Generally, story related conversations always play first. After that is sidequest related conversations, and after that is random stuff.</p>

<p>The types are referred to as such on this page:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>High Priority</b> (Story convos)</li>
    <li><b>Medium Priority</b> (Sidequest convos) [called "Less Priority" in game files]</li>
    <li><b>Low Priority</b> (Random convos)</li>
</ul>

<h4>ACT 2</h4>

<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> Heya, stardust! How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<h4>ACT 3 and 4</h4>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Hey, stardust. How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<br>

<h1 id="high">High Priority</h1>

<br>

<h1 id="act2">ACT 2, first death against the King</h1>
<p><b>Status:</b> High Priority.</p>
<p><i>You receive this convo when approaching Loop after the King kills you for the first time in ACT 2.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Heya, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You were just fighting the King for the first time, weren't you...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> He's pretty strong, isn't he? Didn't he kill you in one shot???</p>

<br>

<p><i>(He sure did.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You can still feel that hit... Your whole body is wracked with tremors.)</i></p>
<p><i>(And what it did...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Hm, what to do, what to do...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> I feel like... Finding a way to win against the King would be a good first step?</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Is there a way for you to survive his first attack? Maybe you should ask your Housemaiden, or look around Dormont...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Anyway! How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<br>

<h1 id="friendquest">Friendquests</h1>
<p><b>Status:</b> High Priority.</p>
<p><i>You receive this conversation when talking to Loop after reaching the end with all Friendquests completed for the first time. You can get this in ACT 3 or 4.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Welcome back, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide5):</b> "..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> Power of love didn't cut it, huh?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> That's too bad. I was hoping this could be it somehow, too.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> But at least you found out more about your party, didn't you? You had fun, didn't you?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide5):</b> "What is it all good for, if they'll all forget it in the next loop?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> Yeah, but...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(For once, Loop seems at a loss for words.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>If this conversation was obtained in ACT 4:</h3>

<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> ...Well, anyway...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You've helped your party during one loop. You talked to the King, and, well, found out some things, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> Maybe you should find out more about the loops now, don't you think?</p>

<br>

<h4>If you haven't done Loop's hangout yet:</h4>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Come and talk to me later. I can help you figure out what to do next.</p>

<br>

<h4>If you have Memory of Memories:</h4>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> And you can read some of that weird language now. Maybe there's some place you should go to, that you couldn't access before in the House...?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> And, knowing you, there's probably some books you didn't want to look at before, didn't you? Maybe you should try and read them, now.</p>

<br>

<h4>Regardless of condition:</h4>

<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> In the meantime, though...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<h1 id="kingquest">Kingquest</h1>
<p><b>Status:</b> High Priority</p>
<p><i>You get this after the Bonnie incident at the end of ACT 3. For more, see <a href="/acts/act3-4/kingquest.html">Kingquest</a>.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b>  ...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide5):</b>  "..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b>  ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  Hey--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide5):</b>  "Stop."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide5):</b>  "Just say 'I told you so', and we can move on."</p>
<p><b>Loop (angry1):</b>  I TOLD YOU SO!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b>  Teehee, what a stupid idea you had!!! Thinking the King could be turned good!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b>  He's the King!!! He's probably the reason you're here, or related to it, at least!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (angry1):</b>  And all you had to do was find out he shares your tragic backstory for you to feel pity for him. He didn't have to lift a finger!</p>
<p><b>Loop (guilty2):</b>  And because of you... Bonnie was--</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b>  ...
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  Anyway, I told you so.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b>  But... What he said back then...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide4):</b>  "He mentioned something..."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry2):</b>  "Something about 'Wish Craft'."</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b>  He did.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry1):</b>  "What's 'Wish Craft'?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b>  ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b>  I don't know.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b>  Wish Craft... Crafting wishes? That sounds impossible, and way too convenient.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b>  But he seemed to imply you were using it? That's what it felt like to me.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (shit1):</b>  "I've never heard of Wish Craft before."
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b>  Me neither. I wouldn't even know where to find information about it.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b>  But... That IS new information.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b>  So, as stupid as the whole "making friends with the King" was...</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  You did find something new.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Was it worth it?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Every time you close your eyes, you still see a hand, tightening.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b>  I'm also wondering... The way you looped last time, wasn't it...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b>  ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  Whatever, it's not like your Kid will remember whatever just happened anyway!</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  Just put it behind you!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b>  And this whole thing gave you something else, didn't it?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b>  Another Memory to equip.</p>


<br>

<p><i>(Oh.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You didn't even notice...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  You'll always remember this, after all.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b>  Let me do the usual.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b>  [You got a MEMORY OF MEMORIES. When equipped, Memory of Memories allows you to read books you couldn't before!]</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b>  The ones written in that language that just gives you a headache. The ones from your country.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Oh, how useful and neat, to be able to read your own blinding language.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You might as well read any books you find, before you forget again.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Like you do everything else.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b>  And, if you can read that language...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b>  Maybe you can explore the House a bit more.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b>  Don't despair, stardust. There's still a path to follow!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>If you haven't done Loop's hangout yet:</b></p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b>  ...You should talk to me about the loops, too I can help you figure out what to do next.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> In the meantime, though...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<br>

<h2 id="lq1">After learning about Time Craft</h2>
<p><i>For this chat, you need to talk to the Head Housemaiden at least once in ACT 3, start talking to the King, and find the first book about Time Craft in the Candle Room. Those things can be done in any order to trigger this.</i></p>
<p><i>Doing this lets you proceed with the Loop hangout.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> "So."</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Sooooooo?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (um2):</b> "Got any theories about the loops I'm trapped in?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Why would I?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (um2):</b> "Your name is LITERALLY 'Loop'."</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> Oh, stars above, it is! Teehee!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(URGH.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> But just because I call myself "Loop" doesn't mean I know anything! I'm just bad at names!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> But I'll see what I can do. What's your question?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (neutral3):</b> "Do you know anything that could help?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> Such a broad question, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> As I've told you before... I know as much as you do, right now.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> "How can that be?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> What do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> "Aren't you here to help me?"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (shit1):</b> "Why don't you know more about the loops you're supposed to help me with...?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> Tee--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (um2):</b> "Don't you 'Teehee' me."</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Awwwwwwwww.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> I still don't have a good answer for you, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Isn't it already nice that you have me to talk to about those loops?</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> You could be alone, stuck with only your tiny brain for company, with no one to talk to!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> "..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Okay, okay, okay...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Well...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> Why don't we summarize what we know about those loops? We might find something out!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You sigh, and nod.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Nothing better to do, you suppose.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Soooooo...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> You're currently stuck in a time loop, for some unknown reason.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> The loop starts when you wake up in Dormont, and seems to end when you talk to the Head Housemaiden...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (neutral1):</b> "Unless I die first, or touch a Tear."</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Yes... Maybe the loop considers getting frozen in time by those Tears a sort of death?</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> But why aren't you looping back when you get frozen in battle...?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (surprised1):</b> <i>(Huh? Isn't it because...)</i> "I thought the Tears worked differently than an actual time freeze skill."</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Is that so? ...Well, you're the one getting frozen, so you'd know...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> So, you loop if something keeps you from advancing in some way...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> I wonder if other things would count as "keeping you from advancing".</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (surprised3):</b> "Like what?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Like...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> What if we cut off your legs, would you immediately loop back? You can't "advance" if you have no legs, right?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (um2):</b> <i>(Um...)</i> "I'd rather not test that one."</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> Awww. But understandable.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(But it is interesting, though.)</i></p>
<p><i>(What makes the loop actually loop?)</i></p>
<p><i>(You feel like... You can remember a few times when time looped back on its own, even if it was just a few minutes...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> Maybe... Does the loop consider talking to the Head Housemaiden... Something that keeps you from advancing, somehow?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Oh...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Maybe, but...)</i></p>
<p><i>(What would "advancing" even mean, then?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Towards what goal?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Is there something that happens when you talk to the Head Housemaiden that makes a certain goal impossible to accomplish?)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (well3):</b> As you've found out, all of this might be the work of Time Craft, a power that should be impossible to use...</p>
<p><b>Loop (subdued1):</b> But you and the King are somehow able to manipulate it.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> <i>(But...)</i> "Am I manipulating Time Craft if I can't control it?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> But you can, can't you?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> You can more or less control where you come back. Except when you talk to the Head Housemaiden, it seems, which brings you back to the start.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> But just being able to loop back in time and avoid death might count as you being able to use Time Craft.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> <i>(But if Time Craft is supposed to be too dangerous to even use...)</i> "How did I get that power?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> And how can you break the loop for good?</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake2):</b> Yes, those are the big questions, aren't they?</p>
<p><b>Loop (well3):</b> ... I do wonder about the limitations of your powers, still.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> What makes you actually loop?</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> Somehow, I feel like finding out more about that would be useful...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Stardust, we've been talking for a while, so maybe not right now, but...</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> When you have some time, will you hang out with me for a bit?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (surprised1):</b> <i>(Huh?)</i> "Hang out?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> I have... A theory I'd like to test. And...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> And we haven't spent any time together, stardust!!! I'm lonely!!! I want to have a long conversation with someone, anyone!!! I wanna hang ouuuuuut!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Urgh.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Again, it doesn't have to be right now.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> Our little hang out time might last a while. Maybe even longer than the rest of the day.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> I'm sure you have plans for this loop, so I can wait until you have time!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...Okay?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(A theory Loop would like to test about the loops...?)</i></p>
<p><i>(It might be useful.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You should talk to Loop and hang out with them when you have time, then.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Yay!!! I'll be waiting, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> In the meantime...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<br>

<h2 id="lq2">After finding out about Wish Craft</h2>
<p><i>This one can only be obtained in ACT 4, after reading the journal in the room behind the star-shaped door. Requiring Memory of Memories means it's locked behind completing Kingquest, and Siffrin refuses to read it until all Friendquests were completed at least once.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> Hi stard--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "Loop!!!"</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> Woah! Y-yes?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (happy1):</b> "You heard it, didn't you?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh1):</b> Heard what? You know, I don't actually spy on you all the ti--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (nya1):</b> "I found it, Loop!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "Wish Craft!!!"</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh1):</b> Wish Craft...? The thing the King spoke of?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "I found it in a book, Loop!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "The writer said they wanted to create a whole new body, and used Wish Craft for it!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged2):</b> "Wish Craft made their wish come true!!!"</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh1):</b> Create a whole new body?! That's--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (nya1):</b> "Impossible, right?"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "But they did it, with Wish Craft!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "It's real, Loop, it has to be!!!"</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> A Craft that allows you to do the impossible... Like creating a body...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (nya1):</b> "Like looping in time!"</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> Like, maybe... Freezing people in time, as well?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(That's right...)</i></p>
<p><i>(If the King knows about Wish Craft, could Wish Craft be how he got the power to Craft time?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Did he use Wish Craft to be able to use Time Craft?)</i></p>
<p><i>(It makes sense, doesn't it? Doesn't it?!?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (oh1):</b> Huh...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Ha! Stars, that's something, isn't it? That's a new lead!!!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (nya1):</b> "Finally, right?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Finally, indeed!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> Well. You know what to do, don't you, stardust?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (happy1):</b> "Find more information!"</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> Indeed you do.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Not to send you on another book chase, but...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (um1):</b> "Book time."</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Book time.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You can read those weird books now, can't you? Maybe one of them might mention it...</p>

<p><i>(Hm...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Alright! Now that you're here, though...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<br>

<h2 id="lq">After asking about wishes</h2>
<p><i>This one is for talking to Loop after asking the people of Dormont for their wishes and looking at the Head Housemaiden's list in her office. Doing this enables you to talk to her again and end ACT 4.</i></p>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...Heya, stardu--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "LOOP!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged2):</b> "I figured it out, Loop!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "Everyone's wish-- It's probably the reason I'm here!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "Everyone's wish to save Vaugarde!!!"</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh1):</b> ...Huh?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged2):</b> "It makes sense, Loop!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "I'm looping and not dying so we can beat the King!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "Everyone has been wishing for Vaugarde to be saved from the King!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "And if I die-- The King can't be beaten, Vaugarde can't be saved!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged2):</b> "That's why I can loop back in time, Loop! THAT'S why!!!"</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> What? But then, why--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "This whole time-- I might be trapped because Vaugarde wished for it!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged2):</b> "Vaugardians don't know the ritual for the Favor Trees, but their belief and hope alone might have been enough!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "An entire country of people wishing for the same thing should be enough to make the Universe listen, isn't it?"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "And the Head Housemaiden knows this! She made a list!"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> ...How do I put this...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> The times when you loop back on your own, and not because of your death...</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> I was thinking the reason why might be linked to your emotional state.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Huh?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Emotions are often high, when you loop back in those moments, aren't they?</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> So maybe you don't loop because you die... But because you feel like there would be no reason to go on, maybe?</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> Something that, to you, feels on the same level of hopelessness as death? On the same level as the world ending?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry2):</b> "Something like the death of my family members, you mean?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> ...Yes.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> But wouldn't that fit? Wouldn't that explain it?</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> You can't continue, because your party is dead.</p>

<br>

<p><b>If Bonnie yelled at you during the 2nd Snack Break:</b></p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> You can't continue, because the Kid is crying and hates you.</p>

<p><b>If Siffrin noticed the shoulder touch:</b></p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> You can't continue, because the Fighter rejected you.</p>

<br>

<p><b>If you got the <a href="/events/tutorial#event">Tutorial</a> event:</b></p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> You can't continue, because you killed a Sadness in a way that makes them scared of you.</p>

<br>

<p><b>If you got the <a href="/events/ghost.html">Ghost</a> event:</b></p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> You can't continue, because you all saw a ghost of yourself and they're reacting like nothing's wrong.</p>

<br>

<p><b>If you got the Suspicous event:</b></p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> You can't continue, because your Researcher has found out about your loops and hates you for keeping them secret.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (subdued1):</b> You can't continue, because the King has beaten you, and the Kid is about to die.</p>

<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> Hi, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> I feel like I see you pretty often. Are you sure you don't have anything better to do?</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> If I was in your place, which I'm not... I'd spend my time in the House forever, getting stronger and stronger.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Anyway! How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<br>

<h1 id="lotsnlots">Talk to Loop even more</h1>
<p><i>Talk to Loop fifteen or more times.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (serious1):</b> HERE AGAIN?!?</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> You really like to talk to me, huh stardust? It's been more than 15 times already!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry3):</b> <i>(Urgh.)</i> "I'm soooo sorry for bothering you."</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> I forgive you, stardust.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> But, hm... Maybe you should get something as a reward, don't you think? For coming to talk to me so often.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> A secret tutorial! Maybe you'll know about it already, though.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> So! There's an item you can give to your party if you talk to them in Dormont. Did you know that?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#floweryes">If you have found the Bright Flower before</a></li>
    <li><a href="#flowerno">If not</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="floweryes">If you have found the Bright Flower before:</h3>

<p><i>(Is Loop talking about that flower...?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> How did you not find it already?!?</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> You should explore Dormont a bit more, stardust! There's a flower you can get, and give it to your party.</p>

<br>

<h3 id="flowerno">If you have not found the Bright Flower before:</h3>

<p><i>(Is there...?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> Yes, yes!</p>

<br>

<h3>Regardless of the Bright Flower</h3>

<p><b>Siffrin (fufu1):</b> "Is the tutorial about how I can give you that flower, too?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (angry1):</b> What?! No, gross!!! I don't want it!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> I don't want any of your stuff. But...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> I am a bit of a special case still, and so, there's a couple items you can show me, if you wanted.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Is that so...?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> I'm too lazy to open new choices for you in our conversations, though.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> So just stand kinda close to the tree, and just interact with your Souvenirs. Maybe I'll have something to say about it!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> So, in simpler terms...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> [If you use a Souvenir near me, I might react to it!]</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Hm...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> Anyway! How can I help you?</p>

<br>

<h1 id="parasite">Parasite</h1>
<p><i>If you told Isabeau the Favor Tree might have a <a href="/rooms/dormont/isatalk.html#parasite">parasite</a>.</i></p>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> A parasite, huh?</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> You wound me, stardust!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> Anyway! How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>
