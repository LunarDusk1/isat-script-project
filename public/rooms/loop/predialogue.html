<h1>Loop Pre-Dialogue</h1>
<small>Created by Felikitty in collaboration with bibliomaniac and codacheetah</small>
<p>WIP note: reformat to new standard.</p>
<p>A list of chats initiated by Loop, before you're able to select anything.</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> Common Event 0162 (PreDialogue)</p>

<h2>Types</h2>
<p>Loop's conversations are sorted by priority. Generally, story related conversations always play first. After that is sidequest related conversations, and after that is random stuff.</p>

<p>The types are referred to as such on this page:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>High Priority</b> (Story convos)</li>
    <li><b>Medium Priority</b> (Sidequest convos) [called "Less Priority" in game files]</li>
    <li><b>Low Priority</b> (Random convos)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="basic">Basic Hellos</h1>
<h4>ACT 2</h4>

<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> Heya, stardust! How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<h4>ACT 3 and 4</h4>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Hey, stardust. How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<br>

<h1 id="high">High Priority</h1>

<br>

<h1 id="act2">ACT 2, first death against the King</h1>
<p><b>Status:</b> High Priority.</p>
<p>You receive this convo when approaching Loop after the King kills you for the first time in ACT 2.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Heya, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You were just fighting the King for the first time, weren't you...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> He's pretty strong, isn't he? Didn't he kill you in one shot???</p>

<br>

<p>(He sure did.)</p>
<p>(You can still feel that hit... Your whole body is wracked with tremors.)</p>
<p>(And what it did...)</p>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Hm, what to do, what to do...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> I feel like... Finding a way to win against the King would be a good first step?</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Is there a way for you to survive his first attack? Maybe you should ask your Housemaiden, or look around Dormont...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Anyway! How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<br>

<h1 id="friendquest">Friendquests</h1>
<p><b>Status:</b> High Priority.</p>
<p>You receive this conversation when talking to Loop after reaching the end with all Friendquests completed for the first time. You can get this in ACT 3 or 4.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Welcome back, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide5):</b> "..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> Power of love didn't cut it, huh?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> That's too bad. I was hoping this could be it somehow, too.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> But at least you found out more about your party, didn't you? You had fun, didn't you?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide5):</b> "What is it all good for, if they'll all forget it in the next loop?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> Yeah, but...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p>(For once, Loop seems at a loss for words.)</p>

<br>

<h3>If this conversation was obtained in ACT 4:</h3>

<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> ...Well, anyway...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You've helped your party during one loop. You talked to the King, and, well, found out some things, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> Maybe you should find out more about the loops now, don't you think?</p>

<br>

<h4>If you haven't done Loop's hangout yet:</h4>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Come and talk to me later. I can help you figure out what to do next.</p>

<br>

<h4>If you have Memory of Memories:</h4>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> And you can read some of that weird language now. Maybe there's some place you should go to, that you couldn't access before in the House...?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> And, knowing you, there's probably some books you didn't want to look at before, didn't you? Maybe you should try and read them, now.</p>

<br>

<h4>Regardless of condition:</h4>

<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> In the meantime, though...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<br>

<h1 id="kingquest">Kingquest</h1>
<p><b>Status:</b> High Priority</p>
<p>You get this after the Bonnie incident at the end of ACT 3. For more, see <a href="/acts/act3-4/kingquest.html">Kingquest</a>.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b>  ...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide5):</b>  "..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b>  ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  Hey--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide5):</b>  "Stop."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide5):</b>  "Just say 'I told you so', and we can move on."</p>
<p><b>Loop (angry1):</b>  I TOLD YOU SO!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b>  Teehee, what a stupid idea you had!!! Thinking the King could be turned good!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b>  He's the King!!! He's probably the reason you're here, or related to it, at least!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (angry1):</b>  And all you had to do was find out he shares your tragic backstory for you to feel pity for him. He didn't have to lift a finger!</p>
<p><b>Loop (guilty2):</b>  And because of you... Bonnie was--</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b>  ...
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  Anyway, I told you so.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b>  But... What he said back then...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide4):</b>  "He mentioned something..."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry2):</b>  "Something about 'Wish Craft'."</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b>  He did.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry1):</b>  "What's 'Wish Craft'?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b>  ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b>  I don't know.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b>  Wish Craft... Crafting wishes? That sounds impossible, and way too convenient.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b>  But he seemed to imply you were using it? That's what it felt like to me.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (shit1):</b>  "I've never heard of Wish Craft before."
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b>  Me neither. I wouldn't even know where to find information about it.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b>  But... That IS new information.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b>  So, as stupid as the whole "making friends with the King" was...</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  You did find something new.</p>

<br>

<p>(Was it worth it?)</p>
<p>(Every time you close your eyes, you still see a hand, tightening.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b>  I'm also wondering... The way you looped last time, wasn't it...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b>  ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  Whatever, it's not like your Kid will remember whatever just happened anyway!</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  Just put it behind you!</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b>  And this whole thing gave you something else, didn't it?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b>  Another Memory to equip.</p>


<br>

<p>(Oh.)</p>
<p>(You didn't even notice...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  You'll always remember this, after all.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b>  Let me do the usual.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b>  [You got a MEMORY OF MEMORIES. When equipped, Memory of Memories allows you to read books you couldn't before!]</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b>  The ones written in that language that just gives you a headache. The ones from your country.</p>

<br>

<p>(Oh, how useful and neat, to be able to read your own blinding language.)</p>
<p>(You might as well read any books you find, before you forget again.)</p>
<p>(Like you do everything else.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b>  And, if you can read that language...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b>  Maybe you can explore the House a bit more.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b>  Don't despair, stardust. There's still a path to follow!</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>If you haven't done Loop's hangout yet:</b></p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b>  ...You should talk to me about the loops, too I can help you figure out what to do next.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> In the meantime, though...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>

<h2 id="lq">After asking about wishes</h2>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> What? But then, why--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "This whole time-- I might be trapped because Vaugarde wished for it!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged2):</b> "Vaugardians don't know the ritual for the Favor Trees, but their belief and hope alone might have been enough!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "An entire country of people wishing for the same thing should be enough to make the Universe listen, isn't it?"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged1):</b> "And the Head Housemaiden knows this! She made a list!"</p>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> The times when you loop back on your own, and not because of your death...</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> I was thinking the reason why might be linked to your emotional state.</p>

<br>

<p>(Huh?)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Emotions are often high, when you loop back in those moments, aren't they?</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> So maybe you don't loop because you die... But because you feel like there would be no reason to go on, maybe?</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> Something that, to you, feels on the same level of hopelessness as death? On the same level as the world ending?</p>

<br>

<p>(You think about a House, exploding in lights.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry2):</b> "Something like the death of my family members, you mean?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>If Bonnie yelled at you during the 2nd Snack Break:</b></p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> You can't continue, because the Kid is crying and hates you.</p>

<p><b>If Siffrin noticed the shoulder touch:</b></p>

<br>

<h1 id="return">Come back to Loop for the first time</h1>
<p>This one is for ACT 2, when you go back to talk to Loop for the first time. If I'm reading the conditions right, it's when you loop back to Dormont after the Head Housemaiden's office is locked off for the first time and you're stuck. Loop sobs at you to say hi.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Aw, you did come and see me!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> Was it because you felt sorry for me, all alone under this big tree? That's so sweet, stardust!</p>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Hm...</p>

<p><b>Siffrin (um1):</b> (A Craft Skill to talk to Loop, even when you're not near them?) "That seems impossible."</p>

<br>

<p>(!)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Yes, stardust.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> A fourth hand shape. So you can talk to me whenever. Are you interested?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> So, take your hand, and make a fist.</p>

<br>

<p>(You do so.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> Then, you're going to raise your thumb and little finger.</p>

<br>

<p>(Raise thumb, raise little finger...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> And, keeping your hand in that shape, you're going to put your hand next to your face, with the thumb to your ear and little finger to your mouth.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> THAT'S the secret hand shape no one knows about.</p>

<br>

<p>(Interesting...)</p>
<p>(You've never heard about this, but you have a bad memory. You may have just forgotten it.)</p>

<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> HAHA!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> Yes, that's definitely the silly part of this ritual.</p>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Well, mostly whenever. It might not work, sometimes. Especially if you get too far.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> And we won't be able to chat very long or anything, so you'll still need to come whenever you want a breather, or need to chat.</p>
