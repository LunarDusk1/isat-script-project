<h1>Loop Chats</h1>
<p><b>Source:</b> Common Event 163</p>
<p><i>All the various Loop chats, whenever you ask "Let's talk about something." An attempt was made to sort them by when a player is likely to get them.</i></p>
<p><b>Thank you CodaCheetah for initially compiling these, and allowing me to mirror their spreadsheet!</b></p>

<br>

<p><i>Whenever you talk to Loop, there is a 1 in 23 chance to get a specific chat. However, a lot of chats have additional conditions, meaning you need to fulfill the condition, and </i>then<i> get favorable RNG.</i></p>
<p><i>It's also entirely possible to miss chats because you no longer fulfill the requirements, such as progressing to the next ACT.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>There are 23 chats in total, though only 21 are available if you do not keep the Dagger. If you give the dagger up, you still get the "Behind the Scenes" achievement after 21 chats. The "We have nothing to talk about" convos do not count toward the achievement.</i></p>

<p><b>This page contains discussion of self harm and suicide. To skip, avoid all conversations surrounding the Dagger.</b></p>

<h1 id="annoying">"Are you getting on my nerves on purpose?"</h1>
<p><b>Condition:</b> ACT 2.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> "Are you getting on my nerves on purpose?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> Yes, I actually manufactured this personality especially to get on your nerves, stardust!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You can't tell if that's sarcasm or not.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Either way, it's working really well.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="thoughts">"Can you read my thoughts?"</h1>
<p><b>Condition:</b> ACT 2.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (um2):</b> "Can you read my thoughts?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> Nah, I just have very good intuition!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Like somehow, I can tell what you're about to say. Soooooo weird.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Suspicious.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> 

<br>

<p><i>(.............................)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="stardust">"Why 'stardust'?"</h1>
<p><b>Condition:</b> ACT 2 or 3.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (questions1):</b> "Why 'stardust'?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> ...Because you're what's left, I suppose.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (surprised1):</b> <i>(What's left?)</i> "What's left of what?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> And because it's a cute nickname! You're my little stardust! My little cutie patootie stardust!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (um2):</b> <i>(Ew. But...)</i> "Just say you don't want to answer, it's fine."</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> But it's so much fun to annoy you instead! Distracting people with puns and jokes is the best way to evade stupid questions.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Yeah, you can relate.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="alone">"What do you do, when I'm not here?"</h1>
<p><b>Condition:</b> ACT 2 or 3.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (neutral3):</b>  "What do you do, when I'm not here?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol2):</b> Excuse you, my life doesn't revolve around you! I do loads of things while you're gone.</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> Like... I look at the sky. And, um... I take a nap sometimes. Dream about things.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (questions1):</b> "What do you dream about?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> What do YOU dream about?

<br>

<p><i>If you are in ACT 3 or 4, this conversation will forcibly appear first, before all others.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> No, my turn!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> So! I'm sure you must have questions about me at this point. Theories.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> About who I am. Might be. That sort of stuff. Am I correct?</p>

<p><i>(Of course you do.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Loop's just too mysterious. Suspicious from head to toe.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Of course you do. I'm just too mysterious, suspicious from head to toe.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> So! Lay it on me! I'm so curious as to what you think.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Who, or what, do you think I am?</p>

<br>

<h2 id="notreally">"Uh, not really?"</h2>
	
<p><b>Loop (angry1):</b> HA? No? No theories? At all?!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> You don't care enough about me to think about who I am? I'm so hurt, stardust!</p>

<p><i>(Urgh.)</i></p>
