<h1 id="convo">Conversation structure</h1>
<p><i>Uh. How the standard convo goes. <a href="/rooms/loop/predialogue.html">PreDialogue</a> happens first.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> Heya, stardust! How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (questions1):</b> <i>(Questions, questions...)</i> "What should I do next?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> What you should do? Well...</p>

<br>

<p><i>Insert What To Do (pictured below) here.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Anything else?</p>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "Nah, nothing."</p>

<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> See you later, stardust!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(They wave at you excitedly.)</i></p>

<h4>First and second time:</h4>
<p><i>(You awkwardly wave back as you go...)</i></p>

<h4>Third to fifth time:</h4>
<p><i>(You wave back as you go.)</i></p>

<h4>Sixth time onwards:</h4>
<p><i>(You wave back as you go, smiling.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="start">Start</h1>
<p><i>If you go back to talk to Loop right after your first meeting with them.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Well, stars, I don't know.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> Did you get to the top of the House so you can fight the King yet?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(. . .)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> I dunno! Just an idea!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> Come on stardust! You can do it! I believe in you~!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (um2):</b> <i>(Urgh.)</i> "You're sooooo helpful."</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> I really am. Thank you for noticing.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Don't worry. I know there's that big pesky trap in the way, but I'm sure you'll find a way around it, if you just look.</p>

<br>

<h1 id="tear">First Tear</h1>
<p><i>After passing the Death Corridor successfully and got frozen by the first Tear.</i>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Oh, you passed the trap, see?</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Knew you could do it, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> And you found out about Tears, didn't you? Very useful little things. Annoying, too.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> But you might find yourself in a situation where you need to loop back, and dying against a monster takes soooo long!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(They're not wrong...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Of course I'm not wrong, stardust.

<br>

<h1 id="boss1">First Boss</h1>
<p><i>If you reached the first boss but didn't beat it.</i></p>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You're up against that big Sadness, aren't you?</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> It's not easy to beat, so make sure you're all stocked up on items before you go!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> And, oh, don't forget you can loop back, well, forwards?</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> If you found a way to die here, in Dormont, you'd be able to loop back to Floor 1.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> With all the doors opened, too, if you remember to press [button] when you're dead!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (n-nya2):</b> <i>(But...)</i> "How does that even work?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> You pretty much loop back and dissociate the whole way to wherever you need to go.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Your allies won't notice a thing though, so it's all good!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> Good luck with that big Sadness! Remember, if battles are tough, there's a few things you could do.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You can go and pick up tonics in the rooms you've seen, you can fight Sadnesses for EXP, make sure you and your party have the equipment you need...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> You can go to the Change God's statue in Dormont, too! Or help out some of the villagers, they might have a gift for you at the end!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Good luck, stardust! I believe in you!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="floor2">Second Floor</h1>
<p><i>Reaching the second floor before entering Euphrasie's office.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> You beat that big Sadness!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> So you're on... Floor 2 now, right?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Some spooky things there. Nothing that dangerous, though!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> The library's on that floor, too... You don't have to read the books there, but they're interesting!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> You're not quite halfway there yet, but you're close! Don't give up, stardust! I believe in you!</p>

<br>

<h1 id="rock2">Rock Trap The Second</h1>
<p><i>After the rock trap blocks off Euphrasie's office from reentry for the first time.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> Big rock trap again, huh? That's what happens when you don't look hard enough, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> <i>(Urgh.)</i> "Hard to see things with one eye."</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You'll miss things no matter what, especially with your sight reduced. You shouldn't feel bad.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> You can loop back and look everywhere again, after all!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(That was... a surprisingly nice thing to say.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> I'm always nice, stardust!</p>

<br>

<h4>At the Favor Tree</h4>
<p><i>Additional dialogue if you're talking to Loop at the Favor Tree instead of calling them.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (shit1):</b> <i>(And yes, you came to see Loop, but...)</i> "It's gonna be a pain to go back to Floor 2..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Not really? You could always loop back, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> So, you know, find an easy way to die somewhere in Dormont.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> There's an easy loop-back spot somewhere. I wonder if you can find it...?</p>

<br>

<h1 id="library">Library</h1>
<p><i>After reaching the library but before the second boss.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy3):</b> You found the key in the Head Housemaiden's office! Congrats, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> That library is quite something, isn't it? You definitely don't have to, but I'd recommend looking around and reading a bit!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> Knowledge is never wasted!</p>

<br>

<h1 id="boss2">Second Boss</h1>
<p><i>Seeing the second boss but not beating it.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> You found all the keys for the second floor, didn't you? Congrats, stardust!</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> Big enemy ahead, though... Two whole enemies!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> Good luck with it! Remember, if battles are tough, there's a few things you could do.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You can go and pick up tonics in the rooms you've seen, you can fight Sadnesses for EXP, make sure you and your party have the equipment you need...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> You can go to the Change God's statue in Dormont, too! Or help out some of the villagers, they might have a gift for you at the end!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Good luck, stardust! I believe in you!</p>

<br>

<h1 id="floor3">Third Floor</h1>
<p><i>Reaching Floor 3 but before having to go back to Floor 2.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> You did it, you're on Floor 3!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy3):</b> This is the last floor before the King. This floor will have a bunch of Tears blocking your way, too.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> One of those blocked paths will surely have what you're looking for, but it doesn't mean the other paths are useless! Do your best!</p>

<br>

<h1 id="cryingkey">Crying Key</h1>
<p><i>After being forced to loop back due to missing the Crying Key from Floor 2.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Ah, you have to go back to Floor 2, don't you?</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> There's something waiting for you in the classroom on Floor 2! How exciting!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> <i>(...)</i> "I missed something again."</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> Stardust, you're missing an eye. Of course you'd miss things.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Maybe you wouldn't miss things if your party took the time to help you search instead of chatting.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> <i>(Hey...)</i> "It's not their fault."</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> Sure, it's not.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> And it's not your fault either, stardust.</p>

<br>

<h1 id="unlock">End of Floor 3</h1>
<p><i>After unlocking the last door with the Crying Key but before you see the third boss.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Ah, you're so close to the end of Floor 3, stardust!!! So close!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Too bad you have to backtrack for that key...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> Who knew the key for a door on Floor 3 would be in the classroom on Floor 2?</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> Have fun walking there, stardust~!</p>

<br>

<h4>If you went to the bathroom:</h4>

<p><b>Loop (lol2):</b> Heh, AND you went to the bathroom! Doing such a great job over there, stardust.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(.........)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> Don't worry, I don't ALWAYS watch you. I have more interesting things to do with my time.</p>

<br>

<h4>Always:</h4>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> You can do this, stardust!</p>

<br>

<h1 id="boss3">Third Boss</h1>
<p><i>Seeing the third boss but not beating it.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You're against a big Sadness again, aren't you? The last one before the King.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> Good luck with it! Remember, if battles are tough, there's a few things you could do.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You can go and pick up tonics in the rooms you've seen, you can fight Sadnesses for EXP, make sure you and your party have the equipment you need...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> You can go to the Change God's statue in Dormont, too! Or help out some of the villagers, they might have a gift for you at the end!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Good luck, stardust! I believe in you!</p>

<br>

<h1 id="shield">The Quest for Adorable Moving Shield</h1>

<h2>Dying to the King for the first time</h2>
<p><i>After dying to the King's instakill for the first time.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Is there a way for you to survive the King's first attack? Maybe you should ask your Housemaiden, or look around Dormont...</p>

<br>

<h2>After talking to the Bored Librarian</h2>

<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> Shouldn't you go to the House's library? You might find a way to survive the King's first attack.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> Remember! The library is on the second floor!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> It might be faster to just die and loop back there immediately... Don't forget to press [button] while dead so you don't have to open any doors!</p>

<br>

<h2>After unlocking the skill</h2>

<p><b>Loop (happy3):</b> You've got it, stardust. All you have to do now is beat the King!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> If you're not strong enough, you can always fight Sadnesses to gain power. Make sure your friends are leveled up, too.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> Come on stardust! You can do it! I believe in you~!</p>
