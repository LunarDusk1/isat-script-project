<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "Nah, nothing."</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> See you later, stardust.</p>

<h2>Start</h2>
<p><i>Before talking to Mirabelle at the start of ACT 3.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Hm, well...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy3):</b> Sounds like your Housemaiden wanted to talk to you, didn't she? You might as well talk to her this loop, before you forget.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="mira">Mirabelle</h2>

<p>"Mirabelle."</p>

<br>

<h3>First</h3>
<p><i>After talking to her and asking what she needs help with, but before finding her papers.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> So your Housemaiden is hiding something? Some papers?</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> She implied at the time that she has more of those papers somewhere in her dorm... Maybe you should go and take a look!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> Be careful, though! She might be watching you closely, since that's her room. You might have to be sneaky about it!</p>

<br>

<h3>Second</h3>
<p><i>After finding her papers, but before talking to her again.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol2):</b> You found some papers in your Housemaiden's room! The same as the ones she's always reading in Dormont! Mystery solved!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Well, not really solved. They looked like files about different people, didn't they?</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> Each file was about a different person, answering some questions like "where do you see yourself in ten years?" or whatever... I wonder what that's about?</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> You should go back to Dormont and ask her about it!</p>

<br>

<h3>End</h3>
<p><i>After finishing Mirabelle's Friendquest for the first time.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Had a nice time talking with your Housemaiden?</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> So... She feels bad, because she can't love people romantically, and she feels like she can't do what's needed of her, as a Housemaiden...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> She feels like she can't change in the way that's asked of her, since she doesn't want to get in a relationship, ever.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> Must be hard. Having a crisis of faith like this.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...Sounds like talking to you helped her, though.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> And talking to her didn't help you, but it made her stronger, which is all you can ask for, huh?</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> Don't forget! If you want her to get that special skill again, you'll have to hang out with her once more.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> Or, well, you could do it and zone out the whole time if you wanted to. But that's cheating!</p>

<br>

<h2 id="isabeau">Isabeau</h2>

<p>"Isabeau."</p>

<br>

<h3>First</h3>
<p><i>Before asking what he needs help with</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Him, huh...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Why don't you ask him if he needs help?</p>

<h3>Second</h3>
<p><i>After asking what he needs help with, but before doing his Friendquest.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Him, huh...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> Your Fighter apparently wants you to help everyone else first. Scary...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Don't you think he's asking you to finish helping everyone first because he wants to ask you something really complicated???</p>

<br>

<p><i>(That's what YOU'RE thinking!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Well, only thing you can do now is helping everyone else, stardust!</p>

<br>

<h3>End</h3>
<p><i>After completing Isabeau's Friendquest for the first time.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Had a nice time talking with your Fighter?</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> What a nice guy. He prepared everything so you could watch the night sky, because he noticed you liked the stars, and he wanted to spend some time with you.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Who knew he had such a history with the Change belief, too...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Heh, come to think of it, he might represent the Change belief better than your Housemaiden does. She must hate that.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> And he tried to tell you something at the end, too. Do you think it's the same thing he always tries to say, at the end?</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> He'll never spit it out, poor guy.</p>

<br>

<h4>If Siffrin didn't figure it out:</h4>
<p><i>(That's right...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You wonder what he wants to say to you, every time.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<h4>If Siffrin figured it out:</h4>
<p><i>Triggered either by getting the hand touch five times or the interrupted confession thrice.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> Teehee.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="odile">Odile</h2>

<p>"Odile."</p>

<br>

<h3>First</h3>
<p><i>Before asking her what she needs help with.</i>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Her, huh...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Why don't you ask her if she needs help?</p>

<br>

<h3>Second</h3>
<p><i>After asking her but before finding the Familytale.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Ah, the researcher...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> She's looking for a sort of book called a "familytale", huh? Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> I've never heard of those... Maybe the librarian in Dormont might know something?</p>

<br>

<h3>Third</h3>
<p><i>After finding evidence of the familytale in the Secret Library.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> Oh, her!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> So, she's looking for a familytale, and one such book might be owned by someone in Dormont...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> That's great news, isn't it? That there's one here, in the village?</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> You should talk to your Researcher and let her know!</p>

<br>

<h3>End</h3>
<p><i>After finishing Odile's Friendquest for the first time.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Your researcher...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> So, she was looking for a familytale, maybe the whole time you've known her.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy3):</b> Familytales are a Vaugardian tradition, and as half-Vaugardian, she felt like it would bring her closer to her roots...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> And that's why she came to Vaugarde, even. To find out more about herself.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> Being able to go wherever you want, and find more about yourself in the process...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> Well, that sure was interesting, wasn't it?</p>

<br>


<h2 id="bonnie">Bonnie</h2>

<p>"Bonnie."</p>

<br>

<h3>First</h3>
<p><i>Before asking what they need help with.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Them, huh...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Why don't you ask them if they need help?</p>

<br>

<h3>Second</h3>
<p><i>After asking them what they need and getting their favorite foods wrong. (I mean, technically you can skip right past to acing it, yeah?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Them, huh...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> You need to prove to them that you know their favorite foods... How childish!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Don't you take snack breaks every so often in the House? You should pick some different snacks every so often, instead of going for your favorites.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> You might find out something new!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> Or you can brute force it, and talk to them until you get it right. That's what looping is for, after all.</p>

<h3>Bonnie's Foods Refresher</h3>
<p><i>Once you've found out at least one food by repeating snack breaks, Loop reminds you of them. For some reason, there isn't an option for rice and samosas. Don't look at me!</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (oh1):</b> What, need a reminder on their favorite foods?</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh1):</b> Well, so far, you've found out that they like...</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>Loop (hm1):</b> ...Rice? Well, who doesn't love rice.</li>
  <li><b>Loop (lol1):</b> ...Pineapples! The thing you're allergic to!</li>
  <li><b>Loop (hm1):</b> ...Rice, and pineapples.</li>
  <li><b>Loop (hm1):</b> ...Samosas, with potatoes, no cheese. So specific!!!</li>
  <li><b>Loop (hm1):</b> ...Pineapples. And samosas, with potatoes, no cheese.</li>
  <li><b>Loop (hm1):</b> ...Rice, pineapples, and samosas with potatoes but with no cheese. That's all of them, isn't it?</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (oh1):</b> Go on, then! Go and find out their favorite foods!</p>


<br>



<h3>End</h3>
<p><i>After completing Bonnie's Friendquest for the first time.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You got to hang out with that Kid, didn't you?</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> So all this time... They felt guilty, because they feel like they're the reason you're half blind...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> What a silly idea.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> But, they're dealing with a lot right now.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Their sister is frozen in time, they had to run away from their home to escape the King's Curse, and they had to see you and your stupid eye every day.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> No wonder they don't know what to do with all these thoughts rattling in their brain. No wonder you felt like they hated you.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> But isn't it nice? To not be hated, anymore?</p>

<h4>Without Bonnie's Friendquest done in this specific loop:</h4>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Well. I suppose you're still hated, now.</p>

<br>


<h2 id="friendhelp">"I just need help in general."</h2>

<h3>Start</h3>
<p><i>If you haven't done all Friendquests yet.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Okay, well...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> At this point, you should try and see if anyone needs your help!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> Nothing more to it than that. Let me know if you need help on how to help a specific one.</p>

<br>

<h3>Middle</h3>
<p><i>After you've done all Friendquests, but haven't reached The End with all of them done yet.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> So you helped them all out, at least once during the same loop!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Helping them was fun, right? Too bad there's nothing else to do.
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> <i>(...)</i> "I'd like to go through the whole House with them now, though."</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> Huh? Why?</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Well... It won't hurt, I suppose.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Make sure to help them out in the same loop, then go from the House's entrance, and have your little snack times, all the way to the Head Housemaiden.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> ...WITHOUT looping forwards and backwards.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> I wonder if anything will change, though.</p>

<br>

<h3>End</h3>
<p><i>After you've reached The End with your family once.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> What, you need help with your "family members" again?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You know what to do. Just help them all out in the same loop, and go through the House with them.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(But you know it won't change anything.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> It really won't.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> <i>(So...)</i> "Do I really need to help them again?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Hm...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> Do you WANT to help them again?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> <i>(...)</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>"Yes, of course."</li>
  <li>"..."</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (subdued1):</b> Heh.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Well, you can help them again if you want, but you don't really need to.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> They'll do just fine without you, you know!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Who do you think you are? Their savior?</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Silly.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> If you do help them, you can just zone out and fast forward to it, if you get bored!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> And you'll still get a nice skill for them out of it!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol2):</b> I pity them, though. I wonder if they'd think you're doing this out of obligation.</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> Or worse, just because it makes your life easier.</p>

<h2 id="kq">"What should I do now?"</h2>

<h2 id="kq1">First</h2>
<p><i>Start of ACT 3, before talking to the King for the first time.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Well... I think it's a stupid idea, but...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You should go and talk to the King. Sounds like you have some questions to ask.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (surprised3):</b> "You don't agree?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> He's a giant monster who might be related to the reason why you're trapped in time.</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> I would never have anything to say to him.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> But you do! So have fun!</p>

<br>

<h2 id="kq2">Second</h2>
<p><i>After talking to the King for the first time.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> So you talked to the King.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Seems like he's using some type of Craft called Time Craft to freeze people in time, huh?</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> Time Craft... I don't know much about it, myself.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> But, as always, if you need information about something, you should read a book!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Maybe ask the Librarian in the Dormont library? She might know something.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="kq3">Third</h2>
<p><i>After reading the book on Time Craft in the Floor 1 Candle Room.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> So, thanks to that book, you found out that you and the King might be using Time Craft, to rewind and stop time, respectively.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> But Time Craft has long been hypothesized to be impossible to control, since it'd ask a lot from the person using it...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> How can both you and the King use a power that should kill any other person...?</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> What gave you that power...?</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> ...You should probably ask your new friend the King about it!</p>

<br>

<h2 id="kq4">Fourth</h2>
<p><i>After talking to the King for a second time.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> So the King might not be from Vaugarde...?</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> That IS interesting information.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (joke1):</b> <i>(You smile smugly.)</i> "Sounds like asking him stuff was a good idea, huh?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Yeah, yeah, stardust, you were right.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> We really don't know anything about him, so any new information IS useful.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> ...Your Housemaiden mentioned she saw some articles about the King somewhere, didn't she?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy3):</b> If she saw some, maybe you should check around rooms that you explore every time while going through the House...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> It might be a lot of information, though, so make sure you ask yourself the right questions!</p>

<br>

<h2 id="kq5">Fifth</h2>
<p><i>After examining the newspaper in the Floor 1 Writing Dorm.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> The King's armor has some star patterns on it...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> I saw them, but never thought anything of them.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> "Most people don't know anything about the stars, do they...?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> They sure don't. You barely do, most of the time, don't you? But then...</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> How does the King remember?</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> And why does he care about stars, to the point he has them on his armor?

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> Someplace that has something to do with the stars...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You guess so...)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>If you've visited the observatory before:</h4>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> You know where to go, don't you? You've found it already</p>

<p><i>(You know where to go.)</i></p>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> . . .</p>

<br>

<p><i>(. . .)</i></p>
<p><i>(The stars, your memories...)</i></p>
<p><i>(The fact that the King, every single time you face him, asks you if you can remember...)</i></p>
<p><i>(What does he want you to remember...!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You know, you know already, but...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...You have to go and ask him.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="kq7">Seventh</h2>
<p><i>After asking the King "What should I remember?"</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> The King says everyone has forgotten something, including himself...</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Including you.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> But why would anyone write down what they've forgotten? Why would anyone know its importance, if they can't remember? Except...</p>

<br>

<h4>If you've never read the Sparkly Diary before:</h4>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> ...I'm actually surprised you haven't found it yet. Not reading a lot of books, are we?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> If you read it... Maybe you'd understand.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Something you have to read...?)</i></p>
<p><i>(You sigh. Time to go hit the books again.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>If you've read the Sparkly Diary before:</h4>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> You know, don't you? Something no one can remember, something other than the stars...</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> You have proof. You just need to go and find it again.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You don't want to have to open that diary again...)</i></p>
<p><i>(But you have to.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="kq8">Eighth</h2>
<p><i>After (re-)reading the Sparkly Diary in the Floor 2 Library.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> So the King is from that country... The country no one can remember.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> The way he asks if you remember, every time you meet him...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> The way he talks about the stars, the Universe...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> I never knew, before... Never would've guessed...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> But then...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> "...Why is he so focused on Vaugarde?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (subdued1):</b> Exactly. Why freeze Vaugarde in time, specifically?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (shit1):</b> "We know he appeared in Vaugarde in his adulthood."</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> In the city of Corbeaux, right?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> It's a nice place to live. And he must've stayed long enough to have put down some roots.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> "He said, earlier..."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (tired1):</b> "He thought Vaugarde was perfect."</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> Perfect... And yet he wanted to freeze it in time.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> Freezing something perfect in time...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> Somehow, it reminded me of something, but I forgot, teehee!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You should look around for something similar to what he wants.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Come to me if you get stuck, I might've remembered what "freezing something perfect in time" is making me think of...</p>

<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Like a picture.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(!)</i></p>
<p><i>(A picture...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="kq9">Ninth</h2>
<p><i>After reobtaining the Mirror Picture on Floor 3.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> Just go and talk to him.</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> I can tell you want to.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (tired1):</b> "You still disagree?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> I... I don't...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> I don't know.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> I don't know how I feel about any of this.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> Just do what you want.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="kq10">Tenth</h2>
<p><i>After asking the King "What should I remember?"</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> The King is from your country, the one no one can remember.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Something happened to this country, to make it disappear even in people's minds.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> And he wants to freeze Vaugarde in time to make sure that, in a twisted way, it'd never be forgotten...</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> ...What a blinding idiot.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> "Loop..."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry2):</b> "I have to talk to him, one last time."</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry3):</b> "The King is trying to remember our country, trying to keep Vaugarde from meeting the same fate."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry3):</b> "He's deluded, he can't bring it back, but... But..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> But you have to try.</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> ...Just do whatever you want, stardust.</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> Have fun.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="kq11">Last</h2>
<p><i>After. You know.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> There's nothing more to say, don't you think?</p>

<br>

<h2 id="kqrefresher">"I need a refresher..."</h2>
<p><i>The progression of the refresher is at the same pace as the help questions, so for simplicity's sake, they'll also be labelled one through eleven.</i></p>
<p><i>The refresher is additive. As the quest progresses, dialogue is added to the end instead of being replaced. It's possible to zone out during this even on a first readthrough.</i></p>

<br>

<h4>During Kingquest:</h4>

<p><b>Loop (teehee):</b> A refresher? Sure!</p>

<br>

<h4>After Kingquest:</h4>

<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> . . . Sure, stardust.</p>

<br>

<h2>First</h2>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> The King has frozen almost the entire country of Vaugarde, and you're trying to beat him so everything can go back to normal.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> You've beat him before, in fact. You'll keep beating him, of course.</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> You've also decided that he's misunderstood, or whatever, so you've started talking to him to know more about him.</p>

<br>

<h2>Second</h2>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> To freeze people in time, he's using something called Time Craft.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> It's not something simple to do like Rock Craft or Scissors Craft, but a Craft much more complicated and rare.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> But it's what allowed him to freeze the entire country in time.</p>

<br>

<h2>Third</h2>

<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> In fact, it might be the same power you're using, to be able to loop back in time.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> But Time Craft has long been hypothesized to be impossible to control, since it'd probably kill anyone trying to use it...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> And yet both you and the King are fine. How?</p>


<br>

<h2>Fourth</h2>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> He's saying he's able to use Time Craft thanks to the Universe.</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> The Universe, the stars... Things that are familiar to you, but completely unknown to your friends, for some reason.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> He's also from someplace other than Vaugarde.</p>

<br>

<h2>Fifth</h2>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> And the King's armor is covered in stars...</p>

<br>

<h3>Sixth</h3>

<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b>Stars... You can recognize them as stars, but you can't remember anything about them, can you?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> The names of constellations escape you, everyday item names escape you, your childhood escapes you, you can't remember anything.</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake2):</b> And the King keeps asking you if you remember. But you know, don't you?</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> You'll never remember anything. no one ever will.</p>

<br>

<h2>Seventh</h2>

<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> You'll never remember anything about your country. Not its stars. Not its faith. Not the childhood you've spent here.
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> You can't even read or speak your own language.</p>

<br>

<h2>Eighth</h2>

<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> There's proof it existed, though. The diary in the library talks about it.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You can't even say its name, though. Why would you?</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> Even I... I wouldn't be able to say its name even if I tried.</p>

<br>

<h2>Ninth</h2>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> And that's it, isn't it? What the King wants?</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> After having all of his memories of his country erased without warning... Being welcomed into Vaugarde, making his life here...</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> He just wants to make sure what happened to your country doesn't happen to Vaugarde.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> And nothing can happen to Vaugarde if it's frozen in time.</p>


<br>

<h2>Tenth</h2>

<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> How pathetic. He can't accept that it's gone, even now.</p>

<br>

<h2>Eleventh</h2>

<p><b>Loop (subdued1):</b> It's just gone.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> . . .</p>

<br>

<p><i>(. . .)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (tired1):</b> <i>(...)</i> "Loop..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (tired1):</b> "Were you from there, too?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Loop (subdued1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake2):</b> What a WILD idea, stardust! Teehee!!!</p>

<br>

<h2>Last</h2>

<p><b>Loop (subdued1):</b> And you're pathetic, too, for thinking you could make him give up on it.</p>
<p><b>Loop (subdued1):</b> His country. His memory. His life.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious1):</b> Did you truly think you could've swayed him from it? From his wish?</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> You can be so blinding stupid sometimes, stardust!</p>

<br>

<h3>If you zoned out at any point during the refresher:</h3>

<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> That was a lot of information, wasn't it? I don't blame you for zoning out, teehee!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Well. I blame you a little bit.</p>

<br>

<h1 id="lq">Loopquest</h1>
<p><i>"Loopquest" refers to the story line about discovering the truth behind the loops, spanning from the start of ACT 3 to the end of ACT 4.</i></p>
<p><i>For progression details, check out this nifty <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PpWBdh8AKNUrAYqrzJUg9Ml0Q1iXntKCHhAvjMArEUk/edit?usp=drive_link"> spreadsheet</a>!</i></p>

<ul>
  <li><b>ACT 3: Siffrin (neutral1):</b></li>
  <li><b>ACT 4: Siffrin (tired2):</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#lq1">"What should I do now?"</a></li>
  <li><a href="#lqrefresh">"I need a refresher..."</a></li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>"What should I do now?"</h2>

<h2 id="lq1">First</h2>
<p><i>Starting Loopquest by talking to Loop for the first time in ACT 3.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Hm...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmm1):</b> To find out more about the loops, you could try and talk to the King, couldn't you?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You and the King seem to share some kind of control over time... It might be worth it to ask him questions about it.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> And you wanted to go and talk to the Head Housemaiden, too. So, you could go to the King and talk to him, and beat him to talk to the Head Housemaiden.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="lq2">Second</h2>
<p><i>After talking to the King for the first time.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> So you've talked to the King and found out about something called... "Time Craft", was it?</p>

<br>

<h3>If you haven't talked to the Head Housemaiden:</h3>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You should try and find out more about it, but first, you should go and talk to the Head Housemaiden and see if she knows anything.</p>

<br>

<h3>If you have:</h3>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> I wonder where you'd be able to find out more about it.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> There might be a book about it somewhere... Maybe the librarian in Dormont knows something.</p>

<br>

<h2>Third</h2>
<p><i>If you've talked to the King, the Head Housemaiden, and found the first book on Time Craft. Only possible to see with (Call Loop.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> So you've found out more about Time Craft, and the Head Housemaiden just repeated everything when you saw her...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> What else could you do to find out more about the loops...?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Maybe you could talk to someone whose name is "Loop", huh.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Fourth</h2>
<p><i>After talking to Loop in person again and they offer to hang out.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> The loops... Wouldn't it be useful to know how they work, exactly?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> I have some theories I'd like to test...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> So please come and talk to me! And let's hang out! It's important!!!</p>

<br>

<h2>Fifth</h2>
<p><i>After hanging out in Loop and asking in ACT 3. At this point, you're locked out of progression until ACT 4.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> I don't know if there's anything you can do to find out more about the loops right now...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> But you do have other things to do, don't you?

<br>

<h3>With neither Friendquests nor Kingquest complete:</h3>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Help your party, talk to the King...</p>

<br>

<h3>With only Kingquest complete:</h3>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You still have to help your party, after all.</p>

<br>

<h3>With only Friendquests complete:</h3>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> You still have to find out more about the King, after all.</p>

<br>

<h3>Regardless of other quests:</h3>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> You can go back to your loop quest after you're done with this, don't you think?</p>

<br>

<h2>Sixth</h2>
<p><i>Upon starting ACT 4.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Hm...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You found out more about your friends, and the King...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> The King mentioned something. "Wish Craft"...?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...You can read those books in your language, now. Maybe you should explore the House again...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> I'm also pretty sure there's a room you could access now that you couldn't before?</p>

<br>

<h2>Seventh</h2>
<p><i>Upon reading the first Wish Craft book. Only accessible via (Call Loop.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Um, have you found anything new? I wasn't watching.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You have to go and talk to Loop in person!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Eighth</h2>
<p><i>After talking to Loop in person again.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (oh1):</b> So you've found a book mentioning Wish Craft...!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> It could've been fiction, so there's a chance it's not real still...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> But the fact that it was mentioned somewhere means the King didn't invent it, or something.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> I wonder if there are any other books out there mentioning Wish Craft...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Have you opened all the doors you could? You should explore the House more.</p>

<br>

<h2>Ninth</h2>
<p><i>After reading the book on Wish Craft in the Floor 1 Storage Room.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> So Wish Craft is the power to make wishes come true, by using rituals and belief...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> And those Crafted wishes can give the Crafter immense power.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> I wonder if there's other books elsewhere in the House about Wish Craft... Maybe in one of the multiple libraries?</p>

<br>

<h2>Tenth</h2>
<p><i>After reading the book on Wish Craft in the Floor 2 Secret Library.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> So, someone's wish, or multiple wishes, might be the reason you're looping in time...?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> <i>(You've thought about it, and...)</i>
"I don't think it's my wish."</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Hm... And it doesn't seem to be anyone in your party, either.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> So... What did everyone else in Vaugarde wish for?</p>

<br>

<h3>If you haven't talked to the people in Dormont yet:</h3>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> Perhaps you could ask people in Dormont...

<br>

<h3>If you have:</h3>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> Someone mentioned the Head Housemaiden asked them the same thing... But she probably won't answer if you ask her.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> Is there a way to know why the Head Housemaiden asked them this, besides talking to her? Maybe you should search her office, on the second floor...</p>

<br>

<h2>Eleventh</h2>
<p><i>After reading Euphrasie's list in her room on Floor 2. Only accessible via (Call Loop.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You have to go and talk to Loop in person!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Twelfth</h2>
<p><i>After talking to Loop again, and Siffrin decides to talk to the Head Housemaiden.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Go on, then.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Go and talk to the Head Housemaiden.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> No matter what happens... I'll see you soon, alright?</p>

<br>

<h2 id="lqrefresher">"I need a refresher..."</h2>
<p><i>The refresher is additive. As the quest progresses, dialogue is added to the end instead of being replaced. It's possible to zone out during this even on a first readthrough.</i></p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>ACT 3: Loop (teehee1):</b> A refresher? Sure!</li>
  <li><b>ACT 4: Loop (away1):</b> . . . Sure, stardust.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>First</h2>
<p><i>Start of ACT 3.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> I'm repeating what you already know, but... You're stuck in a time loop.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You're repeating the same two-ish days, from when you wake up in Dormont, to, seemingly, when you talk to the Head Housemaiden.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> When you get to the Head Housemaiden, or when you die, you immediately loop back.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> You're not completely helpless though, since you can more or less control when and where you loop back!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> And just the fact that you loop back means you seem to have some kind of control over time... Just like the King.</p>

<br>

<h2>Second</h2>
<p><i>After talking to the King for the first time.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> The King said his power comes from something called Time Craft, so we can assume this is what you're using as well.</p>

<h2>Third</h2>
<p><i>After reading the first book on Time Craft.</i></p>

<br>

<h3>After talking to the King:</h3>

<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> The power to craft Time...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> It has been hypothesized to exist, but was never proven, up until the King appeared.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Time Craft is supposed to ask for immense amounts of power... It was believed that crafting time to pause time for a single second would kill the user immediately.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> So... How did the King get this power? How did YOU?</p>

<br>

<h3>After talking to the Head Housemaiden:</h3>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You also found out that what happened with the Head Housemaiden wasn't a one-off.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> Every time you talk to her, she seems to be repeating the exact same thing, until you loop again.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> She says something is broken, failing, rotting...</p>

<br>

<h2>Fourth</h2>
<p><i>After the Loop Hangout.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> After that, we had our little hangout session!</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...I was wondering about the rules of your loops. You loop back when you die, but there have been times when you looped back without dying, didn't you?</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> You looped back on your own, without dying, when we hung out together.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> But if that's the case... Does something happen with the Head Housemaiden that makes the loops activate, as well?</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> What do all those moments have in common...?</p>

<br>

<h2>Fifth</h2>
<p><i>After finishing Kingquest.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> You did your whole thing with the King, too. That was worse than useless, but...</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> The King mentioned something called "Wish Craft".</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> He seemed to think you were using this "Wish Craft", and also seemed to realize you were looping in time.</p>

<br>

<h2>Sixth</h2>
<p><i>After finding the first book on Wish Craft in the King Room on Floor 3.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> You ended up finding a diary mentioning Wish Craft, which proves the King didn't come up with it on his own, I suppose.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Wish Craft can apparently make any wish come true, even things that seem impossible.</p>
<p><b>Loop (subdued1):</b> Like creating a body... Like freezing people in time... Maybe, like looping in time, as well.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> It's not definite proof, but maybe Wish Craft is how you managed to control Time Craft...</p>

<br>

<h2>Seventh</h2>
<p><i>After finding the second book on Wish Craft in the Storage Room on Floor 1.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> And then, you found another book mentioning Time Craft! [sic]</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> It was very dense, but it pretty much went like this...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Belief + Rituals = Wish Craft.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Belief, how much you want your wish to come true, and rituals, which are actions that strengthen your wish enough to make it come true.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Rituals are more important than belief, but that doesn't make belief unimportant, either.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> But Wish Craft might not necessarily make a wish come true, but instead might give you the means to make it come true.</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> Like for the King... He wished for Vaugarde to be kept safe and perfect, so Wish Craft gave him the means to make his wish come true...</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> ...By giving him the power to freeze Vaugarde in time.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> The book had a lot more than this, like what would happen if multiple people wished for something, or what if two people wished for opposite things...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> So you can always go back to the locked storage room on Floor 1 to refresh your memory!</p>

<br>

<h2>Eighth</h2>
<p><i>After finding the third book on Wish Craft in the Secret Library on Floor 2.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> And then you found a THIRD book about Wish Craft! Aren't you lucky!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> You found out the Favor Trees are actually one way to do Wish Craft, if you know the rituals for it!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> And the "favors" people asked the Tree were just wishes, even if they didn't realize it!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> But the thing is, you seem to be the only one who followed the correct rituals... Maybe that was knowledge you got from where you come from?</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> But the wish you made to the Favor Tree can't be why you're here, right? At least you don't seem to think so. And it's not your party's either.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b>  More so because they messed up their rituals, teehee!</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> But, maybe... If a lot of people wished for the same thing, even if the ritual was wrong... Maybe their wish might come true.</p>

<br>

<h2>Ninth</h2>
<p><i>After reading Euphrasie's list in her room on Floor 2.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Which apparently might be what happened...?</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> The Head Housemaiden found out everyone in Vaugarde seems to have wished for the same thing...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> To save Vaugarde.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> And... It might be why you're stuck looping in time.</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> Maybe the loops exist so that you can beat the King... And that's why you loop back when you die, so that you can get to him and beat him, no matter what...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> But then... Why is the wish centered on you? Why not on your whole party?</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> And why do you loop back without dying, sometimes?</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> I think it's related to your emotional state, and maybe something happens every time that makes you feel like this is the end... And that's why you loop, but...</p>
<p><b>Loop (away1):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> I don't know. I feel like we're missing something.</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> The Head Housemaiden... She might know something...</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> But... No matter what, know I'm with you, okay?</p>

<br>

<h3>If you zoned out at any point during the refresher:</h3>

<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> That was a lot of information, wasn't it? I don't blame you for zoning out, teehee!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Well. I blame you a little bit.</p>

<br>

<h1 id="no">"Nothing, actually."</h1>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Any other questions?</p>
