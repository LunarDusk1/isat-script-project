<h1 id="librarian">Bored Librarian</h1>
<p><i>A quick note: when what gets asked is really hard to read for dialogue choices, so the conditions might not be 100% accurate, but should be close-ish enough?</i></p>
<p><i>I'm not a gamedev, okay.</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Welcome to the library!</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Well. Our selection is kind of lacking. All the good books are in the House.</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> But the House is. Well. Closed until further notice. Since the King. Took residence there. And froze. Everyone in time.</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> ...Are you looking for a book in particular?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (questions1):</b> <i>(Are you?)</i></p>

    <li><a href="#time">"Anything about... Time?"</a></li>
    <li><a href="#skill">"Anything about how to survive a very powerful attack?"</a></li>

</ul>

<br>

<h2 id="time">"Anything about... Time?"</h2>
<p><i>Available the second time talking to the Bored Librarian.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> We, uh. Have a book about clocks somewhere?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Not really what you're looking for.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You let it go.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="skill">"Anything about how to survive a very powerful attack?</h2>
<p><i>Available after dying to the King for the first time in ACT 2, unavailable after finding the CARROT method in the <a href="/rooms/floor2/secret_library.html">Secret Library</a>.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Survive a very powerful attack? Um... Like, crafting a shield?</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> I wouldn't know anything about that... That sounds highly specialized. I don't think we carry that sort of knowledge here.</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> I doubt even the House's library would own something like that...</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> ...Maybe it would be in the secret library?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (um1):</b> <i>(The WHAT.)</i> "The WHAT?"</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> The uh. Secret library.</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> The secret library whose entrance is hidden in the library? That library.</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> One of the walls looks normal, but if you check it carefully it'll reveal the secret library's entrance.</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Technically only the librarians know about it. But you ARE trying to save Vaugarde, so. Don't snitch on me? And don't lose tomorrow?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> <i>(...)</i> "Yeah, I'll try."</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Heh. Cool!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(So the House's library on the second floor has a secret library? Sounds like you should go there and check the walls...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="timecraft">"Anything about Time Craft?"</h2>
<p><i>Available during <a href="/acts/act3-4/kingquest.html">Kingquest</a> after asking the intro questions, until asking the King about Time Craft.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Time Craft? Like, um, specifically?</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> I'm not sure... You should look through books about Craft. We have one here, but it might not talk about Time Craft much...</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> I wonder... Where could you find Craftonomy books...</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time:</b> <i>("Craftonomy?")</i></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> <i>(You make sure to look confused.)</i></li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><i>(The librarian notices your confusion.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Oh, the study of Craft in general is called "Craftonomy".</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> I don't think the libraries here or in the House carry any... Maybe you should look elsewhere?</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> ...Also, why am I thinking about candles right now? Must be nothing.</p>

<br>

<h4>First time only:</h4>
<p><i>(Someplace other than the libraries... Maybe someone's dorm room in the House?)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="familytale">"Any familytales?"</h2>
<p><i>Available after starting Odile's Friendquest until interacting with the list of checked out books in the <a href="/rooms/floor2/secret_library.html">Secret Library</a>.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Familytales...?</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> ...Why would you even want to look at one? Aren't you from outside Vaugarde...?</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Well, either way, we, um, we don't. We don't carry those here.</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> I'm not sure where you'd need to look for one... But I feel like I've seen one recently? It's weird.</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Either way, the library in the House might help?</p>

<br>

<h4>First time only:</h4>
<p><i>(Looks like there's no familytale in this library.)</i></p>
<p><i>(The library in the House, huh... You should look around there, and explore the secret library while you're at it.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="wishcraft">"Anything about Wish Craft?"</h2>
<p><i>Available after finishing <a href="/acts/act3-4/kingquest.html">Kingquest</a>.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> ..."Wish Craft"?</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> That sounds made up. Are you sure that sort of Craft exists?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="nope">(Nope.)</h2>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> No problem! Let me know if I can help with anything...</p>

<br>

<h2 id="wish">Wish</h2>
<p>WIP note: during Loopquest. Add link here later. When asking for everybody's wishes.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You need to ask...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> What I asked the Favor Tree?</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Um. I don't actually believe in that stuff... So I didn't ask for anything.</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> I did help the Head Housemaiden with it. She was asking everyone what they asked for. I don't know why.</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> ...Why are you asking?</p>

<br>

<h1 id="craft">Craft book</h1>

<p><i>(The bookcase is filled with books about Craft.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>After dying to the King for the first time, before asking the Librarian:</h4>
<p><i>(...You can't see anything that could stop the King's onslaught...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Maybe you could ask the Librarian?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>("What is Craft? Crafting for Dummies", "Creative Craft: How To Use Paper Type Effectively", "Scissors Type and Me", "Just Because You're Rock Type Doesn't Mean You Can Destroy Walls", and many more.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>First time only:</h4>
<p><i>(...You should gift that last one to Bonnie.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(Pick up "What is Craft? Crafting for Dummies"?)</i></p>

<ul>
    <li><i>(Yes.)</i></li>
    <li><i>(Nah...)</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>(Yes.)</h2>

<p><i>(You pick up the book and open it at a random page.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>"What is Craft?":</b> "Protection Craft, Creative Craft, and Piercing Craft (or commonly known as Rock, Paper and Scissors Craft) are three branches of Common Craft able to be used by most people."</p>
<p><b>"What is Craft?":</b> "It is the art of molding the world around us as we see fit, like crafting clay into moving figurines, or using paint to create art that blablablabla..."</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You flip through the book.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>"What is Craft?":</b> "Using Craft in battle is taking the creative energy and making it physical to hurt enemies blablabla..."</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You flip through the book.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>"What is Craft?":</b> "Other types of Craft include Body Craft, Time Craft blablabla..."</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You flip through the book.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>"What is Craft?":</b> "Time Craft. You shouldn't be able to Craft time."</p>

<br>

<p><i>(There's a piece of paper taped to the page, with a tiny face drawn on it.)</i></p>
<p><i>(The tiny face is an upside down smiling face saying "hahahahahahahahahahahaha funny joke.")</i></p>
<p><i>(Hm.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>First loop:</h4>
<p><i>(Time Craft not being achievable was the theory for a long time, but the King is able to freeze people in time, isn't he?)</i></p>
<p><i>(And... What just happened... Couldn't it be considered Time Craft, too?)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Second loop onwards:</h4>
<p><i>(And what makes you loop in time could be considered Time Craft, too...)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 2 only:</h4>
<p><i>(Oh well. You don't really care about how you can loop in time, at the moment.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You're just glad you got this power to help everyone!)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>(Nah...)</h2>

<p><i>(You leave the book alone.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="unreadable">Unreadable book</h1>

<p><i>(The bookcase is filled with books about culture.)</i></p>
<p><i>("Travelers Of The World", "The House: Monasteries Of The Change God", "Ka Buan Expressions"... Oh?)</i></p>
<p><i>(There's an old book stuck between the shelf and the wall...)</i></p>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time:</b> <i>(Take it out?)</i></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> <i>(Get the book out again?)</i></li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><i>(Yeah.)</i></li>
    <li><i>(Nah.)</i></li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>(Yeah.)</h2>

<h3>First time</h3>
<p><i>(Pushing some books around, you manage to get a hold of the old book.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Book between your hands, you try to read the title.)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Try as you might, your mind can't seem to get a hold of the letters...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You put it back.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Second time</h3>
<p><i>(You take the book out again.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You put it back.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>With Memory of Memories</h3>
<p><i>(You take the book out again.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You can read its title, now...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Your heart is beating, badump, badump, badump.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It's...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...A translated copy of "The Cursing of Château Castle", issue #2.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You start laughing.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>(Nah.)</h2>

<h4>If you've never read the book before:</h4>
<p><i>(Laziness wins again.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>
<p><i>(You've got better things to do.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Subsequent interactions</h2>
