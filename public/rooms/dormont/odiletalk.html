<br>

<h3>"We can forget about our problems!"</h3>

<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> I suppose so.</p>

<br>

<h3>"There's more important things we could be doing..."</h3>

<p><b>Odile (lol3):</b> There sure are. I would've thought you wouldn't mind any occasion to slack off though.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>"I would never."</li>
  <li>"..."</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> ...

<h3>Regardless of choice:</h3>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> Nonetheless, I'll be there. Poor Boniface probably needs it. Maybe we all do.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> But the room only has three beds, right? I better get a whole bed to myself.</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>ACT 1 & 2: Siffrin (questions1):</b></li>
  <li><b>ACT 3 & 4: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"Mira and Bonnie will probably be sharing..."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (wellactually1):</b> Mirabelle and Bonnie? So who'll sleep on the ground, you or Isabeau?</p>

<br>

  <li>"Isa, of course."</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>"I think me and Isa will share?"</h3>

<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> ...Fascinating.</p>

<br>

<h3>"Isa, of course."</h3>

<p><b>Odile (lol3):</b> Poor man.</p>

<br>

<h3>Regardless of choice:</h3>

<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> ...Anyway, I'll be there. You know, since we already decided earlier we'd meet at the Clocktower and all.</p>

<br>

<h3>ACT 1</h3>

<p><i>(Yeah... You already all planned to meet up at the Clocktower, so was there a need for you to let everyone know?)</i></p>
<p><i>(You could've just met everyone at the Clocktower...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Oh well. Not like you have anything better to do.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>First loop</h3>

<p><i>(Hm... Guess you don't have to talk to everyone again.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Second loop onwards</h3>
<p><i>(You REALLY don't have to talk to everyone again.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Always</h3>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> ...Anything else?</p>

<br>

<h4>Second loop onwards:</h4>
<p><i>(You suppose you don't need to tell her every time...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="fight">"We're fighting the King tomorrow..."</h2>

<p><b>Odile (serious4):</b> We are. I hope you're prepared.</p>
<p><b>Odile (serious3):</b> The King, and the Sadnesses his destruction creates... They possess Crafts capable of slowing us down, or even freezing us in time completely.</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> So, as always, we're counting on you and your speed to keep us out of trouble.</p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 1 & 2:</h4>

<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b>

<ul>
  <li><b>ACT 1: Siffrin (okay2):</b> <i>(Aw...)</i></li>

  <li><b>ACT 3 & 4: Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(It's your role, after all.)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>"...So, you want me in the front again?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> Leading everyone, if possible. You've already proven good at preventing traps and keeping us alive, so I don't see why that has to change.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol3):</b> And as always, you can count on me to provide everyone with intel on any enemies we encounter.</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b> Everyone except Boniface will be on battle duty... But I might ask Boniface to do something as well.</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading2):</b> It might be good for everyone to give the kid something to do...</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> ...Boring tactics talk, I know. I'll shut up and buy items for our journey to the top of the House.</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>ACT 1: Siffrin (joke1):</b> <i>(Ho? Have you found it?!?)</i></li>

  <li><b>ACT 3 & 4: Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(...)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>"Is your field of research TACTICS?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> Oh gems. Are you still trying to figure out what I'm researching?</p>
<p><b>Odile (sigh1):</b> NO, my field of research ISN'T tactics.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Isabeau actually proposed that one last week, late one.</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>ACT 1: Siffrin (um1):</b> <i>(Aw...)</i></li>
  <li><b>ACT 2: Siffrin (um1):</b> <i>(Yeah...)</i></li>
  <li><b>ACT 3 & 4: Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(...)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>"Aw..."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (lol3):</b> Give it up already. None of you will ever figure out what I'm studying.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> It will stay a secret forever.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="after">"What will you do after?"</h2>
<p><i>Only available in ACT 1.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> After tomorrow, if we survive? I wish I had your confidence.</p>
<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> ...Maybe I'll just go home to Ka Bue. I haven't seen my country in many years...</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b> Before I met Mirabelle and Isabeau, my main goal was to travel to Vaugarde and see its many different places, sights, cultures.</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading2):</b> I've already accomplished this by traveling with Mirabelle, so...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (questions2):</b>"Was it all for your research?"</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> ...Yes.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (joke1):</b> <i>("Your research into...")</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>"...travel-ology?"</li>
  <li>"...sights-ology?"</li>
  <li>"...cultures-ology?</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>"Travel-ology" isn't a field of research, Siffrin.</li>
  <li>"Sights-ology" isn't a field of research, Siffrin.</li>
  <li>"Cultures-ology" isn't a field of research, Siffrin.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (nya1):</b> "But it is the field of research you spent your life trying to create..."</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> Stop inventing a backstory for me.</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh2):</b> What about you, what will you do? If we beat the King, that is.</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> Will you go back to your own country, maybe?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (smiling3):</b> <i>(What will you do...?)</i> "Come up with my own field of research."</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> Urgh.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="flower">"Flower for you."</h2>
<p><i>Only available if you have the Bright Flower in your inventory.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> For me? Where did that come from?</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol3):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> Well, nonetheless... Thank you, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> It's not like you to be so thoughtful, so I'll definitely keep it as proof.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Proof of what...?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Well, anyway... She seems happy.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="weird">"Anything weird happen lately?"</h2>
<p><i>Available starting in ACT 2.</i></p>
<br>

<p><b>Odile (up1):</b> Weird...? Like what?</p>
<p><b>Odile (serious2):</b> I didn't see anything weird. Did YOU see anything weird?</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>ACT 2: Siffrin (awkward1):</b> <i>(Too perceptive...!)</i> "Nope! Nothing at all!"</li>
  <li><b>ACT 3 & 4: Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(...)</i> "Nope."</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (what2):</b> ...Okay.</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b> I'll keep an eye out. I do hope you'll also let me know if you see "something weird".</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="help">"Can I help you with anything?"</h2>
<p><i>Available starting in ACT 3.</i></p>
<p><i>For Odile's Friendquest, go to <a href="/acts/act3-4/odilequest.html">Odilequest</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>If you've chosen "Maybe in a second..." when talking to Odile, this option will be "Let's hang out now!" the next time instead, and restart the conversation at the same point as <a href="#letsgo">"I have time now!"</a></i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (lol3):</b> Do I need help with anything? Are you THIS bored, Siffrin?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Odile seems to realize you're genuinely asking.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (hm2):</b> Ah, well. . .</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> ...I'm looking for a certain type of book.</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>First time: Siffrin (surprised3):</b></li>
  <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"A 'type' of book? Not a specific book?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> No, not a specific book.</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> It's... It's a type of book called a "familytale". Have you heard of those?</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>First time: Siffrin (surprised3):</b></li>
  <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#nope">"Nope. What is it?"</a></li>
  <li><a href="#yee">"Oh, I've heard the boulangerie has one of those!"</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nope">"Nope. What is it?"</h3>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> It's a book filled with tales written by a single family, through generations. It's a tradition, in Vaugarde.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan3):</b> ...I...</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan1):</b> I've always wanted to read one. But, since each family has theirs, and it's something you're supposed to keep in one family and not show others...</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan1):</b> I was never able to touch, let alone read one.</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> But I've heard that when a family dies off, the familytale might be taken by Houses.  As a way to save those pieces of history.</p>

<p><b>First time only:</b> <i>(Huh, you didn't know that.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(And so...)</i></p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>First time: Siffrin (questions1):</b></li>
  <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"So you'd like a familytale of a family that died off?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> Yes.</p>

<br>

<h4>First time only:</h4>
<p><i>(Huh!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You never knew she was interested in that.)</i></p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>First time: Siffrin (joke1):</b></li>
  <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
  <li>"...Familytale-ology?"</li>
  <li><i>(Nah.)</i></li>
</ul>

<h3>"...Familytale-ology?"</h3>
<p><b>Odile (wry1):</b> ...Of a sort.</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>Before completing her quest:</b> <i>(Oh!!!)</i></li>
  <li><b>After:</b> <i>(Ha.)</i></li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> ...So, will you help me?</p>

  <li><a href="#yee">"Oh, I've heard the boulangerie has one of those!"</a></li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3 id="yuh">"Yeah, of course."</h3>

<p><b>Odile (huh3):</b> ...Thank you, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Odile (sigh1):</b> Ha. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> I was planning to look in Dormont's library, but I have to buy some supplies.</p>
<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> And I want to look inside Dormont's House, but...  Who knows if we'll have time to search, so...</p>

<br>

<h4>First time only</h4>
<p><i>(...So you should check the libraries at your disposal, and see if you can find a familytale.)</i></p>
<p><i>(So that makes... Dormont's library, the House's, and the House's secret library, at least.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Better start looking!)</i></p>

<br>

<h3 id="yee">"Oh, I've heard the boulangerie has one of those!"</h3>
<p><i>Only available after checking out the list of books in the <a href="/rooms/floor2/secret_library.html">Secret Library.</a></i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (huh3):</b> Wh-what?</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh3):</b> What? What? Huh? Really?</p>

<br>

<h4>Before completing Odile's quest:</h4>
<p><i>(She doesn't seem to know how to react.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You look at her repeat the same words over and over.)</i></p>

<h4>After:</h4>
<p><i>(You wait a bit for her to calm down.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You look at her repeat the same words over and over.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b> ...Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Will you come with me? To ask them if I can borrow it?</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b> It might... Take some time. So make sure you have time to help me.</p>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Odile (sigh1):</b> I'm too busy to help you with your problems right now. Go talk to Isabeau for that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b> You can help me buy some supplies for tonight, though, if you'd like to be distracted.</p>
