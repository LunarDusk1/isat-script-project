<p><i>Siffrin (smiling1):</i> <i>(The usual, please.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>First time in ACT 3</h4>

<p><i>(Here again.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You'd like to make sure Mirabelle doesn't get upset, but is there any way to make this conversation go faster...?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(Something like...)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 3</h4>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(Here again.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 4</h4>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> <i>(Enter Mirabelle.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Dialogue choices</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"Hey Mira."</li>
    <li><b>Available from ACT 3 onwards:</b> "Hey Mira, have you thought about doing a sleepover tonight?"</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>"Hey Mira."</h3>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Hey, Siffrin! Hehehe!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy4):</b> So how was your nap? On a scale of one to ten!</p>

<br>

<h3>How was your nap?</h3>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>ACT 2: Siffrin (questions2):</b> <i>(Hm...)</i></li>
    <li><b>ACT 3 & 4: Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(...)</i></li>

</ul>

<h4>"It was alright."</h4>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> I'm glad! I know how much you value your naps.</p>

<br>

<h4>"Oh, you know."</h4>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> ...That bad? I'm sorry to hear that...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> I hope you'll sleep well tonight! I know how much you value your naps!</p>

<br>

<h3>"Hey Mira, have you thought about doing a sleepover tonight?"</h3>

<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> I-I was actually just thinking about it... What do you think?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "Absolutely! I'll let everyone know!"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> You're right! We don't have a moment to lose!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward2):</b> But, wait, do you know where everyone--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "Talk to you later, Mira!"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> O-okay???</p>

<br>

<p><i>The conversation skips to the <a href="#talkend">ending</a> here.</i>

<h3>Oh, wait!</h3>
<p><i>When picking the regular "Hey, Mira." option.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> Oh, wait! I had something I wanted to ask you!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Um, I have an idea for tonight... This will be the night before we go fight the King, so I felt like we could make it special somehow...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> So, I was thinking, how about a sleepover?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Let's all eat good food together! Sleep in the same room! Maybe tell stories!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> It would be nice, wouldn't it?</p>

<br>

<h4>Third time having this conversation:</h4>
<p><i>(Yeah, you know what to say.)</i></p>
<p><b>Siffrin (smiling3):</b> <i>(Make her happy.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 2:</h4>
<p><b>Siffrin (smiling3):</b> <i>(The usual.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 3 & 4:</h4>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(Say the line, Siffrin.)</i></p>

<p>"That sounds like an AMAZING idea, Mira!"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Yeah? Oh, I'm so glad you think so!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> I was thinking it was a little silly, but if you think it could be fun, then great!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Ah, I can't wait... This will be delightful! I'm smiling just thinking about it...</p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 2:</h4>
<p><i>(You're happy she's happy.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You smile back.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 3:</h4>
<p><i>(Her smile still manages to bring your mood back up.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You smile back.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 4:</h4>
<p><i>(You smile back.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It hurts a little bit.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> --so, could you let everyone know? I would really appreciate it!</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>ACT 2: Siffrin (smiling1):</b></li>
    <li><b>ACT 3 & 4: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (hm3):</b> Okay! Let me think...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (thinking1):</b> Madame Odile should be in the shop buying items, Bonnie should be near the fields to the east, and Isabeau is at the Favor Tree to the west!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy3):</b> We're staying in the clocktower at the east of the town, right past the broken bridge, so you can just tell everyone to meet up there later!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (haha1):</b> ...That was a lot of names and places. Will you remember?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>ACT 2: Siffrin (smiling1):</b> <i>(You think so, yes.)</i></li>
    <li><b>ACT 3 & 4: Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(You really, really will.)</i></li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
    <li>"I always remember things."</li>
    <li><b>Available from ACT 2 onwards:</b> "...Probably not?"</li>
    <li><b>Available from loop 10 onwards:</b> "Odile is at the shop, Bonnie is..."</li>
</ul>

<h3>"I always remember things." / "...Probably not?"</h3>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> ...Well, unrelated to your memory...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> Here's a note with everyone's location! Just in case! You! Forget!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You got the REMINDER NOTE!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You put the note in your pocket along with your Souvenirs.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>"Odile is at the shop, Bonnie is..."</h3>

<p><b>Mirabelle (haha1):</b> ...Well, I'll let you do this then! Sounds like you remember!</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>ACT 2:</b> <i>(You do!)</i></li>
    <li><b>ACT 3 & 4:</b> <i>(You really, really do.)</i></li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Okay, see you at the Clocktower later then! I'll be near the library if you need me, come talk to me whenever!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> Oh, and don't forget to check the Change God's statue too! For good luck!</p>

<br>

<h3 id="talkend">End</h3>

<h4>After dying to the King, before learning how to obtain Adorable Moving Shield:</h4>

<p><i>(Oh, wait...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Maybe Mirabelle would know a way to survive the King's attack?)</i></p>
<p><i>(You should talk to her later...)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>First time telling her about the CARROT method:</h4>
<p><i>(You need to make sure Mirabelle knows how to shield all of you against the King...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You tell her about the CARROT method, whatever it is, so she'll be able to cast it.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy3):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> Oh this makes so much sense.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Mirabelle learned the Craft Skill "Adorable Moving Shield". Again.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>

<p><i>(You tell Mirabelle about the CARROT method so she can learn that one skill...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> W-Wait, how did you know about--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...And wink.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (worried1):</b> O-Okay...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Mirabelle learned the Craft Skill "Adorable Moving Shield" again.)
</i></p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>ACT 1 & 2:</b> <i>(You wave goodbye.)</i></li>

<h2 id="loop0">Loop 0 / ACT 1</h2>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Siffrin! You're up!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (smiling1):</b> <i>(You sure are.)</i> "Hey Mira."</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Hey, Siffrin! Hehehe!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy4):</b> So how was your nap? On a scale of one to ten!</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (questions2):</b> <i>(Let's see...)</i></p>

<ul>
    <li>"1. A certain someone woke me up..."</li>
    <li>"5. Completely average."</li>
    <li>"A solid 9."</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>"1. A certain someone woke me up..."</h3>

<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> I-I'm sorry! I-it's just, that there's a lot to do, and--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (joke1):</b> "How dare you wake me from my slumber."</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> A-ah?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (joke1):</b> "Punishment for one hundred years."</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Hehehe, noooo! Not one hundred years!</p>

<br>

<h3>"5. Completely average."</h3>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> Is that a good or bad thing...?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (questions1):</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>"Average is good!"</li>
    <li>"Average is bad!"</li>
    <li>"Average is average?"</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h4>"Average is good!"</h4>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> Good! I think.</p>

<br>

<h4>"Average is bad."</h4>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1b):</b> Ah... Sorry...</p>

<br>

<h4>"Average is average?"</h4>
<p><b>Mirabelle (hm2):</b> Hm... If you say average more it will stop being a word, I think...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (joke1):</b> "Average average average average."</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Nooo!!!</p>

<br>

<h3>"A solid 9."</h3>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Is it not a ten because... the finish could've used some work...?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (smiling2):</b> "We'll do better next time."</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Next time I promise I'll let you sleep in! So we can get the elusive ten out of ten score!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(How is it different from what you usually do...?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Well...)</i></p>
<br>


<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> "...Okay?"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> Ah... You think it's silly, don't you...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> I'm sorry... I was trying to find something fun to do tonight, but that's all I could think of...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1):</b> It was... It was a stupid idea, wasn't it...? Maybe we should forget about it...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Oh no.)</i></p>
<p><i>(YOUR LACK OF ENTHUSIASM MADE MIRABELLE UPSET!!!!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (awkward1):</b> <i>(Come on fix it!!!!)</i> "N-no, I think it's fun!!! Let's do it!!!"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> Are you sure...? Alright then...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Um... So if we're doing it, can you let everyone know...? I... I don't think I could convince everyone...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> <i>(Well you kinda have to now.)</i> "Of course, Mira."</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (hm3):</b> Okay! Let me think...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (thinking1):</b> Madame Odile should be in the shop buying items, Bonnie should be near the fields to the east, and Isabeau is at the Favor Tree to the west!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy3):</b> We're staying in the clocktower at the east of the town, right past the broken bridge, so you can just tell everyone to meet up there later!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Siffrin! You're up!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Oops, you don't know how to act right now.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You've seen this once before, so you should maybe... Act the same??? Figure something out, quick.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (awkward1):</b> <i>(Quick!)</i> "Hey, uh, hey again, Mira."</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1b):</b> ...Still half asleep, huh? How was your nap?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Okay take two. Say something. Make normal words come out of your mouth.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Can you change it? Can you change fate?!? Only one way to find out...)</i></p>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Um, sorry to bother you while you're so busy, but I REALLY wanted to make sure you were okay...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> You... You'd tell me if anything was wrong, right?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(Where is THIS coming from...)</i> "Of course I'd tell you!"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Siffrin, I...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (serious1):</b> I'm&nbsp; not sure you're telling me the truth here.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (serious2):</b> I don't want to force you to do anything, but you have to know I want you to be happy.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> And I know this is a stressful moment for all of us, but the only way we can get through this is if we talk to each other! If we share our worries!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> S-So, um, I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you need help with anything...!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> I-If you need help with anything, I'm, I'm here for you!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> Do not look at the papers, the papers are irrelevant, do NOT LOOK AT THEM SIFFRIN I SEE YOU LOOKING AT THEM</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You arch an eyebrow, smiling.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> Urgh!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (hmf1):</b> Alright, YES the papers are giving me a lot of trouble and I hate them.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1):</b> But I'm only looking at them now to get worried at something other than, um, tomorrow? They aren't that big of a deal.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> If I have to be worried I'd rather be worried about the thing that won't kill me.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1):</b> There's even more in my dorm room in the House... Those stupid papers have been following me since before the King stuff even started...</p>
