<h2 id="goal">"What's your goal?"</h2>
<p><i>This belongs to the set of three intro questions.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Oh...... My goal...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> Sif... Does it matter?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry1):</b> It doesn't!!! Your reasons don't matter at all!!!</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>Asking for the first time:</b><br> <b>Siffrin (fight3):</b> <i>(But they might!)</i></li>
    <li><b>Asking subsequent times:</b><br> <b>Siffrin (tired1):</b> <i>(...)</i></li>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "Why do you want to freeze Vaugarde in time?"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Siffrin...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oooh, oooooooh...!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Can't you guess......? Can't you tell?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oh, stars...... I thought my intentions were clear...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight1):</b> We don't know! We don't understand you!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight4):</b> Why would you want to make an entire country suffer And expect everyone to be okay with it!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> There must be a reason!!! Why would you freeze Vaugarde in time!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> And only Vaugarde, for that matter?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> That's true... No other country has been attacked.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> With a power like yours, you could freeze more than just Vaugarde.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> But you stopped at the borders. Other countries are safe.  Why?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oooh, ooooooh......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Because...... Vaugarde......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Is perfect.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Perfect...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Such welcoming, creative people.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Always willing to welcome travelers in, even travelers with no name, no home to speak of......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Such...... Precious memories......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> It is perfect. I do not want it to change. I want it to stay exactly how it is.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> So it cannot ever be destroyed.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk2):</b> That's so...</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b> What backwards thinking.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight1):</b> I don't know what about Vaugarde made it perfect for you, but you cannot stop us from living!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>

<h2 id="trapped">"Are you the one doing this to me?</h2>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Oh, oooooh...... "Doing this"......?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>Asking for the first time:</b>
    <i>(Stars, you don't want to explain it in front of everyone...)</i><br>
    <i>(But the King... He could be the one trapping you in time!)</i><br> <b>Siffrin (shit1):</b> "The one imprisoning me here."</li>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Odile (worried2):</b> Imprisoning you...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......Whatever is happening to you, I am not the one responsible, bright one.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> But...... That scent around you, could it be......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> It does not matter.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Asking for the first time:</b></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(He doesn't seem to know what you're talking about.)</i></p>
<p><i>(So the King isn't the one responsible for the loops?)</i></p>
<p><i>(...Isn't that weird?)</i></p>
<p><i>(You're looping through time, he's freezing it...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Aren't you using the same power?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Power over time?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Asking subsequent times:</b></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="how">"How are you freezing people in time?"</h2>
<p><i>This belongs to the set of three intro questions.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> ......Ha.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Pst, Sif, could've told you that one if you asked.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm2):</b> It's Time Craft, buddy.</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>If you haven't heard about Time Craft before:</b><br> <i>(...You don't know what that is.)</i></li>
    <li><b>If you've heard about Time Craft:</b><br> <i>(Time Craft, you've heard this before...)</i></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> Time Craft... The ability to craft time itself.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> But Time Craft is supposed to be impossible to control...</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> How can you use it, yet alone do it as such a grand scale?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Ha...... If the bright one isn't bright enough to know of Time Craft......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> They will not be bright enough to understand how.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Ouch.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> Don't be mean to Frin!!! Shut up!!!

<br>

<p><b>Asking for the first time:</b></p>
<p><i>(Time Craft...)</i></p>
<p><i>(That's something to look into, isn't it?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Either way... It doesn't seem like he's the one trapping you here.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>If you have not talked to the Head Housemaiden in ACT 3:</b></p>
<p><i>(...Since you're here, it might be worth it to beat the King now, so you can go talk to the Head Housemaiden...)</i></p>
<p><i>(She said something before. About how you're looping. About something being broken.)</i></p>
<p><i>(She knew something!)</i></p>
<p><i>(After that, you have to find more information about Time Craft somewhere.)</i></p>
<p><i>(And you can always go back and fight the King if you have anything else to talk about.)</i></p>

<p><b>If you have talked to the Head Housemaiden in ACT 3:</b></p>
<p><i>(...You have to find more information about Time Craft somewhere.)</i></p>
<p><i>(And you can always go back and fight the King if you have anything else to talk about.)</i></p>

<p><b>If you've asked this question before:</b></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="timecraft">"So, you're using Time Craft?"</h2>
<p><i>This question can be asked after rereading the Craftology book in the candle dorm on Floor 1.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Time Craft......? I suppose I am.</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> But, if you're using Time Craft... How did you manage to control it?</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> Time Craft should use immeasurable amounts of power that no mere human could have... So how...</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Ha......!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Yes, it is true...... I could not have harvested Time Craft on my own.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> So...... I had some help.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Help? Who would...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Ooooh, ooooooh...... Isn't it obvious?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> The Universe would.</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time:</b> <i>(!)</i></li>

</ul>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Ah, aaaaaah! I only had to wish for it......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> And the Universe delivered.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward2):</b> "The Universe"...? Who is that? A person?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> Nah, it's, it's...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> Wow, it's on the tip of my tongue, but I can't seem to remember.</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> It's... What's beyond this plane, correct? What's in the sky?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time:</b><i> (You clench your fists.)</i></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> <i>(You do not react.)</i></li>

<br>

<p><i>(The King sobs.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Oooh, oooooooh......!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Aaaah!!! I knew Vaugardians were ignorant of it...... But I did not think travelers from other countries were, too......!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> How...... How could you have......</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> "Vaugardians", huh...</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Interesting choice of words. Are you not from Vaugarde yourself?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> He isn't, madame Odile... I feel like I've seen an article about it somewhere recently.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward2):</b> I saw it today... Where was it again?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm2):</b> So you're not from Vaugarde, but you still want to freeze it in time?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really3):</b> Where do you call home, then?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(The King flinches.)</i></p>
<p><i>(He does not answer.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>First time:</b></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You shake your head, and breathe out.)</i></p>
<p><i>(An article about the King, somewhere...)</i></p>
<p><i>(If Mirabelle remembers it, you might've seen it somewhere too. Could it be somewhere in the House?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Subsequent times:</b></p>
<p><i>(You do not react.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="remember">"What should I remember?"</h2>
<p><i>This question can be asked after interacting with the big window inside the observatory on Floor 3.</i></p>
<br>

<p><b>First time:</b>
<p><i>(Every single time you face him...)</i></p>
<p><i>(He asks if you remember.)</i></p>
<p><i>(There's something he thinks you should know... Should remember... But...)</i></p>

<p><b>Subsequent times:</b></p>
<p><i>(You ask again, but you know, you know, you know.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> Does it really matter, Siffrin? He could just be trying to confuse you.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> Yeah!!! Speaking in riddles to Frin!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry1):</b> Stop trying to confuse him! He hasn't forgotten anything!!!</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time:</b> <i>(But you have, haven't you?)</i><br><i>(You try not to think about it, but... But...)</i></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> <i>(You know, you know, you know.)</i></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide4):</b> "What have I forgotten?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Forgotten?
<p><b>King:</b> Oh, bright one, bright one, why...... Why would you ask......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Don't you know at this point what you've forgotten? Haven't you always known?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Can't you see the hole it has left behind, if not what used to fill it?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Don't you feel it? Its absence?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fight1):</b> What the crab is he--</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ALL OF IT!!!!!! </p>
<p><b>King:</b> YOU'VE FORGOTTEN IT ALL, BRIGHT ONE!!!!!! THEY ALL HAVE!!!!!! WE ALL HAVE!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> No one can say it!!! No one can even remember it!!! It escapes us, it will keep escaping us!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Ooooh, why don't you remember?! I can tell!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Everything, from your accent, to the way you use Craft, to the stitching on your cloak and hat, to those pins you wear--</p>
<p><b>King:</b> You should remember!!! You and I, of all people standing here, should remember!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Bright one, please, please!!! Just remember it!!! Say it!!! Make it real!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Please...... If you can remember, then...... Then maybe......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> What is happening? Is he okay...?</p>
<p><b>Odile (worried1):</b> Something we've all forgotten...?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> I haven't forgotten anything, stupid!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm4):</b> ... Sif...?</p>

<br>

<p><b>First time:</b></p>
<p><i>(Something you've forgotten.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Something everyone has, even if they don't pay attention to it.)</i></p>
<p><i>(The hole it has left behind.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Something bigger than just the stars.)</i></p>
<p><i>(What you're trying to remember doesn't exist anymore, but...)</i></p>
<p><i>(But someone might still have written proof it existed, haven't they?)</i></p>

<p><b>King:</b> Vaugarde doesn't know...... No one knows that I am doing what needs to be done!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> They do not understand!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Someone who selfishly does what needs to be done, against the will of the people......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> In Vaugarde, such a person can only be called a King.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> So you know!!! You know that what you're doing is wrong, that no one wants to be frozen in time!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Against the will of the people...... Yes.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Against the will of the Universe...... No.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> It is not wrong. Our will is not wrong.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I just want Vaugarde to stay like this. Forever. Forever. Forever......</p>
