<h1 id="skill">Shield Skill Book</h1>

<h2>First time</h2>

<p>(The bookcase is filled with some books about Craft Skills.)</p>
<p>(The librarian said you might find something here to protect you against the King...)</p>
<p>(You look closely at the books in this section.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Siffrin? Are you looking for something in particular?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> (Might as well get the book lovers on this too...) "How do you craft shields?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> Like, shields in battle? To protect ourselves?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> It would be useful, wouldn't it... We have skills to boost our defense, but a shield would be cool.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> I-I was thinking about learning! And I feel like I'm close to getting it!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward2):</b> But... I'm not there yet. Sorry.
<p><b>Bonnie (oh!1):</b> This book here is just called "Shields", and it's super dusty.
<p><b>Bonnie (happy1):</b> Dusty books are good, right?</p>

<br>

<p>(Bonnie gives Mirabelle the book.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Well, that's not how it works, but... . . .</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> Wait... Wait a second.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> THAT'S ALL?!?!? THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT?!??!</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> Ah.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> Oh, this sounds fun.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> <span style="font-size:smaller"><i>So then, if I do this, and keep this in mind, and don't forget about this...</i></span></p>

<br>

<p>(Mirabelle mumbles under her breath for a long time...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (serious3):</b> Okay, so...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight1):</b> Siffrin, do NOT move. I'm about to try a highly volatile Craft Skill on you that I've never tried before.</p>

<br>

<p>(UM,)</p>

<br>

<p>(You slowly open your eye.)</p>
<p>(Your body feels like it's covered in a warm blanket...)</p>

<br>

<p>(Suddenly, Bonnie punches you in the stomach.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sad2):</b> Owie.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Siffrin, did you feel something...?</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>
<p>(You didn't feel a thing!)</p>
<p>(You give Mirabelle a thumbs up.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> <span style="font-size:larger">CRAB YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!</span></p>

<br>

<p>(Mirabelle learned ADORABLE MOVING SHIELD!)</p>

<br>

<p>[Stardust! You did it!]</p>
<p>[Your little Housemaiden now knows Adorable Moving Shield! When crafted, it creates a SHIELD that protects your allies from TIMESTOP and SLOW for three turns. It also boosts DEFENSE!]</p>
<p>[You can try to beat the King again now... Make sure to use this skill to survive, okay?]</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> (Well, that's nice and all, but...)</p>

<ul>
    <li>"If it was this easy to learn, why didn't you learn before?"</li>
    <li>(Don't mention it.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>"If it was this easy to learn, why didn't you learn before?"</h4>

<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> Hey, Sif...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Sorry! Sorry!!! But it just, it didn't make any sense before...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1):</b> Sometimes things need to click, you know?</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h4>(Don't mention it.)</h4>

<p>(It's annoying, but she knows it now.)</p>

<br>

<h4>Regardless of dialogue choice:</h4>

<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> (There IS something you need to ask though...) "What made it click, then?"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> Oh, that's easy! It's all about--</p>

<br>

<p>(Mirabelle suddenly bombards you with technical terms!!!)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> --and that's how you do it!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> I did not understand even a little bit of this.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> Hm, I couldn't craft a skill like that myself, but...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> But it's just about using the CARROT method, right?</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Is it? I guess that makes some sort of sense...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> It is! They actually mention it in here too!</p>

<br>

<p>(What's the CARROT method.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> What's the CARROT method.</p>

<br>

<p>Note: A comment in the file for this scene reads as follows: "Can Arrive at a Really Really Outstanding Technique"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> If you don't know the CARROT method, you don't need to know the CARROT method.</p>

<br>

<p>(You sure feel stupider than usual this loop.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> (So, uh...) "So, hypothetically, someone reminding you of the CARROT method would make it click for you?"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> Yes!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(Well there you go.)</p>

<br>

<h2>Subsequent times</h2>

<p>(The bookcase is filled with books about Craft Skills.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (lol2):</b> Wow, look at how old this book just called "Shields" looks!</p>

<br>

<h4>First time:</h4>
<p>(Bonnie is pointing at a book.)</p>
<p>(...That's the book that made Mirabelle learn her skill.)</p>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>
<p>(Bonnie is pointing at that "Shields" book.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> Sniff sniff.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (surprised1):</b> Smells weird.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (and then1):</b> I'm taking it!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(Bonnie takes the book off the shelf and opens it to a random page.)</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (surprised1):</b> Oh, it's a cooking book. It's talking about carrots and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> What? Let me see...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Ah, no, that's the CARROT method, Bonbon, not carrots.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> Oh, the CARROT method!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Siffrin reminded me of it yesterday... That's how I figured out that nice new shield skill!</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> ...Is that so...?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>ACT 2 & 3:</b> (You smile awkwardly.)</li>
    <li><b>ACT 4:</b> (You smile.)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Ah, your new shield skill!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> They show it in this book too, look!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Oh... They do!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> If Siffrin didn't teach me yesterday, this could've been useful...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> But I already know it, book! Siffrin taught me, book! And it'll protect us against the King, book!</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> . . .</p>

<br>

<p>(Odile is staring at you.)</p>
<p>(You look away. Maybe you shouldn't have looked at that bookcase...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (oh!1):</b> Ah, this book mentions shields that reflect attacks, too!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed2):</b> Those are so complicated... I wish I could figure it out someday.</p>

<br>

<h2>Repeated interaction</h2>
<p>(The bookcase is filled with books about Craft Skills.)</p>

<br>

<h1 id="wish">Wish Craft Book</h1>
<p>This book is part of <a href="/acts/act3-4/loopquest.html">Loopquest.</a></p>

<h2>Without Memory of Memories:</h2>
<p>If you can't read it yet cuz you haven't finished <a href="/acts/act3-4/kingquest.html"> Kingquest</a>.</p>

<br>

<p>(The bookcase is filled with moldy old books.)</p>

<br>
<h4>If you've started Odile's Friendquest:</h4>
<p>(No familytales.)</p>

<br>

<p>(One of them is written in a language you cannot read.)</p>
<p>(It has a big, sparkly tree on the cover.)</p>
<p>(Just looking at the title is giving you a headache...)</p>

<h4>If you have Memory of Memories, but its not equipped:</h4>
<p>(But you could read it, if you remembered the Memory of it, wouldn't you?)</p>

<br>

<h2>With Memory of Memories:</h2>
<p>If you haven't read the previous book on Wish Craft at all yet.</p>

<br>

<p>(The bookcase is filled with moldy old books.)</p>

<br>

<h3>If you haven't read the previous book:</h3>
<p>If you haven't read the previous books on Wish Craft in the Floor 3 Star Room and the Floor 1 Storage Room.</p>

<br>

<p>(One of them is written in your language.)</p>
<p>(You can read it, now...)</p>
<p>(...Actually, you can't.)</p>
<p>(There's a lot of hard words in there... You don't know what this is even about.)</p>
<p>(Maybe you should go back to it later...)</p>

<br>

<h3>If you haven't read the previous book in this specific loop:</h3>
<p>You also have to read Storage Room Wish Craft book in the same loop.</p>

<br>

<p>(One of them is written in your language.)</p>
<p>(You can read it, now...)</p>
<p>(...It seems to be a book on different rituals to Craft wishes!)</p>
<p>(You could read it now, but you haven't read the previous Wish Craft book with everyone, back on Floor 1.)</p>
<p>(You might miss some precious insights, if they don't understand what you're talking about... You should come back after reading the first book again.)</p>

<br>

<h3>With all conditions met:</h3>

<h4>First time:</h4>

<p>(One of them is written in your language.)</p>
<p>(You can read it, now...)</p>
<p>(...It seems to be a book on different rituals to Craft wishes!)</p>
<p>(You flip through it...)</p>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>

<p>(You've read the Wish Craft rituals book before, but it wouldn't hurt to get a refresher...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (awkward1):</b> Oh, another wiggly headachy book.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (oh!1):</b> Is this another book on Wish Craft?</p>

<br>

<p>(You nod.)</p>
<p>(You start translating as best you can...)</p>
<p>(The book talks about many different rituals to Craft wishes, from the correct way to pick up 4 leaf clovers, to calling out to shooting stars the right way, to...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (happy2):</b> Favor Tree what now?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> THE FAVOR TREES CAN GRANT WISHES?!?!?</p>
<p><b>Odile (uwah!1):</b> FAVOR TREES LIKE THE ONE IN DORMONT?!?!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (omgggg1):</b> THE ONE EVERYONE ASKED THINGS TO?!?</p>

<br>

<h4>First time:</h4>
<p>(Aha!!!)</p>
<p>(It makes sense, it makes sense!!!)</p>
<p>(You even vaguely remember thinking about it, a long time ago!!!)</p>
<p>(Asking a higher power for a favor is no different than making a wish, isn't it? Isn't it???)</p>
<p>(So, could someone's wish to the Favor Tree have trapped you here? Whose?)</p>
<p>(What)</p>
<p>(What did you wish for, at the Favor Tree, again?)</p>
<p>(You think and think and think, trying to remember what you even wished for.)</p>
<p>(It was so far back!!! Such a long time ago...)</p>
<p>(. . .)</p>
<p>(You wished...)</p>

<br>
<p>This depends on which character you chose to wish on in ACT 1.</p>
<ul>
    <li>(You wished... to visit more places with Mirabelle.)</li>
    <li>(You wished... to wear clothes Isabeau has made.)</li>
    <li>(You wished... to see Odile's country with your own eyes.)</li>
    <li>(You wished... to be here when Bonnie reunites with their sister.)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>(Was that all?)</p>
<p>(You think so.)</p>
<p>(Oh.)</p>
<p>(It can't... It can't be because of your wish, then.)</p>
<p>(You haven't even gotten farther than beating the King, let alone leaving the House to make that wish come true.)</p>
<p>(Your wish can't come true until you escape the loops...)</p>
<p>(. . .)</p>
<p>(So then, maybe...)</p>

<br>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>
<p>(Your wish isn't what's trapping you here.)</p>
<p>(You know what they all wished for, but might as well ask again...)</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (surprised3):</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"What did you all wish for?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> To the Favor Tree, you mean?</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> Well, I mentioned it earlier, but I... Wished... To win a coin flip.</p>

<br>

<h4>If Odile didn't win it:</h4>
<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b> A wish that didn't come true, by the way.</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm2):</b> Well, I might have done the correct ritual, but I didn't put any belief in it, did I?</p>

<h4>If Odile won it:</h4>
<p>Odile (reading1): A wish that came true, now that I think about it.</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm2):</b> I didn't put any belief in it, but the rituals are supposed to be the important part, aren't they?</p>

<br>

<p>(But you know her wish doesn't come true on every loop...)</p>
<p>(Some loops she wins the coin flip, some loops she doesn't.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (sad1):</b> I... I asked for my sister to be okay.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> I-I wished for all of Vaugarde to be safe from the King!</p>

<br>

<p>(Hm...)</p>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (doubt1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (blush1):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> ...What about you, Isabeau?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (blush2):</b> I, um, didn't wish for anything.</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> What.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (UWAH1):</b> WHAT?!?!?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (NO!1):</b> LISTEN!!! I just didn't know what to wish for!!! I'm an indecisive guy!!! Leave me alone!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (sigh1):</b> I can't believe this...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fight2):</b> Oh, m'dame "I'm gonna wish to win my next coin flip" is gonna judge me now?!</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> I didn't think anything would happen!!! At least I wished for something!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (hm2):</b> That's too bad...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> Haaah... Yeah, I'm kinda bummed I didn't wish for anything now.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Why didn't I clap my hands and wish for something...</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (surprised1):</b> (Huh?)</li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (surprised3):</b> (Follow the script...)</li>
</ul>

<p>"Clap your hands?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> Uh, yeah?</p>
<p>Isabeau (neutral1): That's how you ask a favor to the Favor Trees.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> You look at the tree, and clap your hands once, and say aloud whatever you ask for.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Um...</p>

<br>

<p>(Isabeau looks at everyone else.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (uwah!1):</b> Is that... Not correct?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (happy2):</b> No, it's what I did.</p>
<p><b>Odile (doubt1):</b> Me too. This is how you taught me, Isabeau.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> That's also how I learned it at school?</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh2):</b> Siffrin, did you... Not do it like that?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (um2):</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake2):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"No, of course not?"</p>

<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (questions1)</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: (fake1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"You make your wish, and breathe it into the leaf you like best..."</p>
<p>""...and fold the leaf over to keep your wish safe."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> What?</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (awkward1):</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>

<p>"It just... Makes sense?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> ...</p>

<h4>First time only:</h4>
<p>(They're all looking at you!!!)</p>
<p>(You've only wished at a Favor Tree that one time, but it just makes sense!!!)</p>
<p>(You try to explain...)</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (okay2):</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"You choose a leaf, to represent yourself."</p>

<p><b>Odile (gimmme1):</b> Uh huh.</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (questions1):</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"You breathe your wish into it... To make a link between you and whatever you're wishing to."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> So, a link between you and the Tree?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (okay2):</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (hide2):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"No, the Universe? I think?"</p>

<br>

<h4>If the party knows what stars are by interacting with the newspaper on Floor 1:</h4>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> So, the stars and stuff? They're the ones who make your wish come true?</p>

<h4>If they don't:</h4>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> ...What's a--</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (doubt1):</b> Keep going, Siffrin.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (questions1):</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (surprised3):</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (hide1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"If you just look at the Tree and clap and say stuff aloud, why would the wish know where to go?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> ...I suppose so???</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b> That... Kind of makes sense, I suppose.</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> But that's so many details to remember...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> ]And that's not how we were taught at all... It's something we learn as Vaugardians, and I've never heard anyone do it differently...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> But then, the Favor Trees are more of a superstition, aren't they?  No one really takes it seriously.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Well, except lately, where everyone started taking it super seriously just in case.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> So... So...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (stop!2):</b> So did everyone in the country mess up their wish?!?</p>
<p><b>Odile (laugh1):</b> HAH!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(Odile starts laughing.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> Wh-Why are you laughing???</p>
<p><b>Odile (gentle1):</b> Sorry, sorry. It's just funny.</p>
<p><b>Odile (laugh1):</b> This could have been a way to save Vaugarde if everyone somehow wished for it, but no one knew how to do it correctly, so... Ha!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Hmf...</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> And the only person who knew how to do it wished for... ...</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> What DID you wish for, Siffrin?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> (It's embarrassing, so...) "I wished for croissants to be eradicated."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> What.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> What!!! No!!! Not croissants!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> And since Siffrin knew the ritual, croissants might actually be...!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> Oh nooo. I sure hope this specific wish doesn't come true.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder1):</b> But yeah, no one except Sif knew the right ritual, but...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> Rituals are only one part of it, right? Belief is another!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> If enough people wish for the same thing, maybe it can make a difference!</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Heh... A drop of belief in an ocean of nothing.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> Boo.</p>

<br>

<h4>First time only:</h4>
<p>(Hm...)</p>
<p>(So... Mirabelle wished for Vaugarde to be saved, Odile wished to win a coin flip, Bonnie wished for their sister to be okay, and Isabeau didn't wish for anything.)</p>
<p>(You don't think any of those wishes could've trapped you here.)</p>
<p>(So... Maybe someone else's?)</p>
<p>(The King probably wished for Vaugarde to be perfect or something, so you don't think it's related to you...)</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>(Is there a way to know what people in Vaugarde wished for?)</p>
<p>(You should ask the villagers in Dormont what they wished for...)</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> Oh yes, color theory! Are you interested, Siffrin?</p>

<br>

<p>(You shrug.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> Huh...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> What's a color?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (lol2):</b> Hahaha, Za doesn't know what a color is!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> I really don't! Tell me!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> It's, um... Um...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> It's like weird shades.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> I learned it at school, but it wasn't very interesting so I crafted a drawing on my table instead.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> Wow Bonbon, you're so hardcore.</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> They ARE weird shades, yes. This is a relatively new discovery, so I'm not surprised you haven't heard, Isabeau...</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b> ...But a very long time ago, we could apparently see shades called "colors".</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (yeah!3):</b> Yeah! They had a shade called "Bloo" and that's the sky's real shade, and one named "Grin" and that's what the grass looked like!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward2):</b> I think the world around us still are those "colors", but we just, um, forgot how to see them?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1b):</b> Or so researchers say... I think the House over in Corbeaux was researching it.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> That's...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huhwah1):</b> THAT'S SUCH BIG NEWS?!?! HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS?!??!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sniff1):</b> I FAILED YOU ALL...</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> Oh, don't worry. We don't usually count on you to know things.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> ...Oh yeah! That's true!!!</p>

<p>Odile (serious3): Hm...</p>
<p><b>Odile (wonder3):</b> ...Well, I'll have to check after we beat the King, and before I go away...</p>
