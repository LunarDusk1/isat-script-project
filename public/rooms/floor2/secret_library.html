<h1 id="skill">Shield Skill Book</h1>

<h2>First time</h2>

<p><i>(The bookcase is filled with some books about Craft Skills.)</i></p>
<p><i>(The librarian said you might find something here to protect you against the King...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You look closely at the books in this section.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Siffrin? Are you looking for something in particular?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> <i>(Might as well get the book lovers on this too...)</i> "How do you craft shields?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> Like, shields in battle? To protect ourselves?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> It would be useful, wouldn't it... We have skills to boost our defense, but a shield would be cool.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> I-I was thinking about learning! And I feel like I'm close to getting it!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward2):</b> But... I'm not there yet. Sorry.
<p><b>Bonnie (oh!1):</b> This book here is just called "Shields", and it's super dusty.
<p><b>Bonnie (happy1):</b> Dusty books are good, right?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Bonnie gives Mirabelle the book.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Well, that's not how it works, but... . . .</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> Wait... Wait a second.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> THAT'S ALL?!?!? THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT?!??!</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> Ah.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> Oh, this sounds fun.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> So then, if I do this, and keep this in mind, and don't forget about this...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Mirabelle mumbles under her breath for a long time...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (serious3):</b> Okay, so...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight1):</b> Siffrin, do NOT move. I'm about to try a highly volatile Craft Skill on you that I've never tried before.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(UM,)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(You slowly open your eye.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Your body feels like it's covered in a warm blanket...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(Suddenly, Bonnie punches you in the stomach.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sad2):</b> Owie.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Siffrin, did you feel something...?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You didn't feel a thing!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You give Mirabelle a thumbs up.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> CRAB YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Mirabelle learned ADORABLE MOVING SHIELD!)</i></p>

<br>

<p>[Stardust! You did it!]</p>
<p>[Your little Housemaiden now knows Adorable Moving Shield! When crafted, it creates a SHIELD that protects your allies from TIMESTOP and SLOW for three turns. It also boosts DEFENSE!]</p>
<p>[You can try to beat the King again now... Make sure to use this skill to survive, okay?]</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> <i>(Well, that's nice and all, but...)</i></p>

<ul>
    <li>"If it was this easy to learn, why didn't you learn before?"</li>
    <li><i>(Don't mention it.)</i></li>
</ul>

<h4>"If it was this easy to learn, why didn't you learn before?"</h4>

<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> Hey, Sif...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Sorry! Sorry!!! But it just, it didn't make any sense before...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1):</b> Sometimes things need to click, you know?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>(Don't mention it.)</h4>

<p><i>(It's annoying, but she knows it now.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Regardless of dialogue choice:</h4>

<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> <i>(There IS something you need to ask though...)</i> "What made it click, then?"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> Oh, that's easy! It's all about--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Mirabelle suddenly bombards you with technical terms!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> --and that's how you do it!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> I did not understand even a little bit of this.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> Hm, I couldn't craft a skill like that myself, but...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> But it's just about using the CARROT method, right?</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Is it? I guess that makes some sort of sense...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> It is! They actually mention it in here too!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(What's the CARROT method.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> What's the CARROT method.</p>

<br>

<p><i>Note: A comment in the file for this scene reads as follows: "Can Arrive at a Really Really Outstanding Technique"</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> If you don't know the CARROT method, you don't need to know the CARROT method.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You sure feel stupider than usual this loop.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> <i>(So, uh...)</i> "So, hypothetically, someone reminding you of the CARROT method would make it click for you?"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> Yes!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Well there you go.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Subsequent times</h2>

<p><i>(The bookcase is filled with books about Craft Skills.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (lol2):</b> Wow, look at how old this book just called "Shields" looks!</p>

<br>

<h4>First time:</h4>
<p><i>(Bonnie is pointing at a book.)</i></p>
<p><i>(...That's the book that made Mirabelle learn her skill.)</i></p>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>
<p><i>(Bonnie is pointing at that "Shields" book.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> Sniff sniff.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (surprised1):</b> Smells weird.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (and then1):</b> I'm taking it!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Bonnie takes the book off the shelf and opens it to a random page.)</i></p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (surprised1):</b> Oh, it's a cooking book. It's talking about carrots and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> What? Let me see...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Ah, no, that's the CARROT method, Bonbon, not carrots.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> Oh, the CARROT method!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Siffrin reminded me of it yesterday... That's how I figured out that nice new shield skill!</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> ...Is that so...?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>ACT 2 & 3:</b> <i>(You smile awkwardly.)</i></li>
    <li><b>ACT 4:</b> <i>(You smile.)</i></li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Ah, your new shield skill!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> They show it in this book too, look!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Oh... They do!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> If Siffrin didn't teach me yesterday, this could've been useful...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> But I already know it, book! Siffrin taught me, book! And it'll protect us against the King, book!</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> . . .</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Odile is staring at you.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You look away. Maybe you shouldn't have looked at that bookcase...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (oh!1):</b> Ah, this book mentions shields that reflect attacks, too!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed2):</b> Those are so complicated... I wish I could figure it out someday.</p>

<br>

<h2>Repeated interaction</h2>
<p><i>(The bookcase is filled with books about Craft Skills.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="wish">Wish Craft Book</h1>
<p><i>This book is part of <a href="/acts/act3-4/loopquest.html">Loopquest.</a></i></p>

<h2>Without Memory of Memories:</h2>
<p><i>If you can't read it yet cuz you haven't finished <a href="/acts/act3-4/kingquest.html"> Kingquest</a>.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(The bookcase is filled with moldy old books.)</i></p>

<br>
<h4>If you've started Odile's Friendquest:</h4>
<p><i>(No familytales.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(One of them is written in a language you cannot read.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It has a big, sparkly tree on the cover.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Just looking at the title is giving you a headache...)</i></p>

<h4>If you have Memory of Memories, but its not equipped:</h4>
<p><i>(But you could read it, if you remembered the Memory of it, wouldn't you?)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>With Memory of Memories:</h2>
<p><i>If you haven't read the previous book on Wish Craft at all yet.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(The bookcase is filled with moldy old books.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>If you haven't read the previous book:</h3>
<p><i>If you haven't read the previous books on Wish Craft in the Floor 3 Star Room and the Floor 1 Storage Room.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(One of them is written in your language.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You can read it, now...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...Actually, you can't.)</i></p>
<p><i>(There's a lot of hard words in there... You don't know what this is even about.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Maybe you should go back to it later...)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>If you haven't read the previous book in this specific loop:</h3>
<p><i>You also have to read Storage Room Wish Craft book in the same loop.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(One of them is written in your language.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You can read it, now...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...It seems to be a book on different rituals to Craft wishes!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You could read it now, but you haven't read the previous Wish Craft book with everyone, back on Floor 1.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You might miss some precious insights, if they don't understand what you're talking about... You should come back after reading the first book again.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>With all conditions met:</h3>

<h4>First time:</h4>

<p><i>(One of them is written in your language.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You can read it, now...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...It seems to be a book on different rituals to Craft wishes!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You flip through it...)</i></p>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>

<p><i>(You've read the Wish Craft rituals book before, but it wouldn't hurt to get a refresher...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (awkward1):</b> Oh, another wiggly headachy book.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (oh!1):</b> Is this another book on Wish Craft?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You nod.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You start translating as best you can...)</i></p>
<p><i>(The book talks about many different rituals to Craft wishes, from the correct way to pick up 4 leaf clovers, to calling out to shooting stars the right way, to...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (happy2):</b> Favor Tree what now?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> THE FAVOR TREES CAN GRANT WISHES?!?!?</p>
<p><b>Odile (uwah!1):</b> FAVOR TREES LIKE THE ONE IN DORMONT?!?!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (omgggg1):</b> THE ONE EVERYONE ASKED THINGS TO?!?</p>

<br>

<h4>First time:</h4>
<p><i>(Aha!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(It makes sense, it makes sense!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You even vaguely remember thinking about it, a long time ago!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(Asking a higher power for a favor is no different than making a wish, isn't it? Isn't it???)</i></p>
<p><i>(So, could someone's wish to the Favor Tree have trapped you here? Whose?)</i></p>
<p><i>(What)</i></p>
<p><i>(What did you wish for, at the Favor Tree, again?)</i></p>
<p><i>(You think and think and think, trying to remember what you even wished for.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It was so far back!!! Such a long time ago...)</i></p>
<p><i>(. . .)</i></p>
<p><i>(You wished...)</i></p>

<br>
<p><i>This depends on which character you chose to wish on in ACT 1.</i></p>
<ul>
    <li><i>(You wished... to visit more places with Mirabelle.)</i></li>
    <li><i>(You wished... to wear clothes Isabeau has made.)</i></li>
    <li><i>(You wished... to see Odile's country with your own eyes.)</i></li>
    <li><i>(You wished... to be here when Bonnie reunites with their sister.)</i></li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><i>(Was that all?)</i></p>
<p><i>(You think so.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Oh.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It can't... It can't be because of your wish, then.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You haven't even gotten farther than beating the King, let alone leaving the House to make that wish come true.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Your wish can't come true until you escape the loops...)</i></p>
<p><i>(. . .)</i></p>
<p><i>(So then, maybe...)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>
<p><i>(Your wish isn't what's trapping you here.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You know what they all wished for, but might as well ask again...)</i></p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (surprised3):</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"What did you all wish for?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> To the Favor Tree, you mean?</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> Well, I mentioned it earlier, but I... Wished... To win a coin flip.</p>

<br>

<h4>If Odile didn't win it:</h4>
<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b> A wish that didn't come true, by the way.</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm2):</b> Well, I might have done the correct ritual, but I didn't put any belief in it, did I?</p>

<h4>If Odile won it:</h4>
<p><i>Odile (reading1):</i> A wish that came true, now that I think about it.</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm2):</b> I didn't put any belief in it, but the rituals are supposed to be the important part, aren't they?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(But you know her wish doesn't come true on every loop...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Some loops she wins the coin flip, some loops she doesn't.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (sad1):</b> I... I asked for my sister to be okay.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> I-I wished for all of Vaugarde to be safe from the King!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Hm...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (doubt1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (blush1):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> ...What about you, Isabeau?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (blush2):</b> I, um, didn't wish for anything.</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> What.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (UWAH1):</b> WHAT?!?!?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (NO!1):</b> LISTEN!!! I just didn't know what to wish for!!! I'm an indecisive guy!!! Leave me alone!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (sigh1):</b> I can't believe this...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fight2):</b> Oh, m'dame "I'm gonna wish to win my next coin flip" is gonna judge me now?!</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> I didn't think anything would happen!!! At least I wished for something!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (hm2):</b> That's too bad...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> Haaah... Yeah, I'm kinda bummed I didn't wish for anything now.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Why didn't I clap my hands and wish for something...</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (surprised1):</b> <i>(Huh?)</i></li>

<p>"Clap your hands?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> Uh, yeah?</p>
<p><i>Isabeau (neutral1):</i> That's how you ask a favor to the Favor Trees.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> You look at the tree, and clap your hands once, and say aloud whatever you ask for.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (uwah!1):</b> Is that... Not correct?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (happy2):</b> No, it's what I did.</p>
<p><b>Odile (doubt1):</b> Me too. This is how you taught me, Isabeau.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> That's also how I learned it at school?</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh2):</b> Siffrin, did you... Not do it like that?</p>

    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (um2):</b></li>

<h4>First time only:</h4>

<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> ...I suppose so???</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b> That... Kind of makes sense, I suppose.</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> But that's so many details to remember...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> ]And that's not how we were taught at all... It's something we learn as Vaugardians, and I've never heard anyone do it differently...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> But then, the Favor Trees are more of a superstition, aren't they?  No one really takes it seriously.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Well, except lately, where everyone started taking it super seriously just in case.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> So... So...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (stop!2):</b> So did everyone in the country mess up their wish?!?</p>
<p><b>Odile (laugh1):</b> HAH!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Odile starts laughing.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> Wh-Why are you laughing???</p>
<p><b>Odile (gentle1):</b> Sorry, sorry. It's just funny.</p>
<p><b>Odile (laugh1):</b> This could have been a way to save Vaugarde if everyone somehow wished for it, but no one knew how to do it correctly, so... Ha!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Hmf...</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> And the only person who knew how to do it wished for... ...</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> What DID you wish for, Siffrin?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(It's embarrassing, so...)</i> "I wished for croissants to be eradicated."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> What.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> What!!! No!!! Not croissants!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> And since Siffrin knew the ritual, croissants might actually be...!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> Oh nooo. I sure hope this specific wish doesn't come true.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder1):</b> But yeah, no one except Sif knew the right ritual, but...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> Rituals are only one part of it, right? Belief is another!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> If enough people wish for the same thing, maybe it can make a difference!</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Heh... A drop of belief in an ocean of nothing.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> Boo.</p>

<br>

<h4>First time only:</h4>
<p><i>(Hm...)</i></p>
<p><i>(So... Mirabelle wished for Vaugarde to be saved, Odile wished to win a coin flip, Bonnie wished for their sister to be okay, and Isabeau didn't wish for anything.)</i></p>

<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> Huh...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> What's a color?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (lol2):</b> Hahaha, Za doesn't know what a color is!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> I really don't! Tell me!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> It's, um... Um...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> It's like weird shades.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> I learned it at school, but it wasn't very interesting so I crafted a drawing on my table instead.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> Wow Bonbon, you're so hardcore.</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> They ARE weird shades, yes. This is a relatively new discovery, so I'm not surprised you haven't heard, Isabeau...</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b> ...But a very long time ago, we could apparently see shades called "colors".</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (yeah!3):</b> Yeah! They had a shade called "Bloo" and that's the sky's real shade, and one named "Grin" and that's what the grass looked like!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward2):</b> I think the world around us still are those "colors", but we just, um, forgot how to see them?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1b):</b> Or so researchers say... I think the House over in Corbeaux was researching it.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> That's...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huhwah1):</b> THAT'S SUCH BIG NEWS?!?! HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS?!??!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sniff1):</b> I FAILED YOU ALL...</p>
