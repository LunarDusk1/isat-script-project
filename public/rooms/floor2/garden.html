<h1 id="npc">Frozen Gardener</h1>

<h4>First time:</h4>
<p><i>(Someone frozen in time.)</i></p>

<h4>Subsequent times, and subsequent interactions:</h4>
<p><i>(Mirabelle's gardening classmate, frozen in time.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> Oh, that's...!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> That's one of the House's cooks. She was in the gardening class with me...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (hm3):</b> She was taking the class to learn how to grow tasty vegetables! She often made soup with the veggies she made...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (haha1):</b> Hehe, once, she said she needed some help breaking apart a turnip she grew, to make it into a soup, so we told her to bring it to class and we'd all help her.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> And next class, she brought the biggest turnip I'd ever seen! She had trouble even fitting it through the door!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> We spent the entire class trying to cut it, it was that big!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Hehe...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sad1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (happy2):</b> How was the turnip?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Oh, it tasted awful.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1):</b> But since she's a cook and really particular about taste, we had to act as if it was delicious.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Thank Change I was taking an acting class too!</p>


<h1 id="closet">Closet</h1>

<p><i>(The closet is filled with gardening supplies.)</i></p>
<p><i>(And...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i><a href="/random/generic.html#weapons">If you already have the Gardening Scissors.</a></i></p>

<br>

<h4>If you don't:</h4>

<p><i>(You got the GARDEN SCISSORS!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You put the Garden Scissors in your pocket to equip later.)</i></p>

<br>


<h4>Regardless:</h4>
<p><i>(There's some gardening books about rare and powerful plants.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Regular:</h4>

<p><i>(None of them catch your eye.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>During <a href="/acts/act3-4/loopquest.html">Loopquest</a>, after reading the Wish Craft book in the Storage Room:</h4>

<p><i>(Powerful plants... Somehow, you're reminded of the Favor Tree.)</i></p>
<p><i>(...One of the books has a section on Favor Trees, but it's pretty useless.)</i></p>
<p><i>(The bottom of the page says "For more information on this topic, check out...")</i></p>
<p><i>(You can't read the title they're recommending.)</i></p>
<p><i>(They do mention the cover of the book they're recommending has a picture of a big, sparkly tree.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Can you find that book somewhere...?)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Repeated interaction:</h4>

<p><i>(The closet is filled with gardening supplies.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="bigplant">Big plants</h1>

<p><i>(Very big plants.)</i></p>
<p><i>(...And some tonics? This room is a mess.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You pick up the tonics.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You got two SUPER SOUR TONICS!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You got one SWEET TONIC!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You give them to Bonnie for safekeeping.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Repeated interaction:</h4>
<p><i>(Very big plants.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="tinyplant">Tiny plants</h1>

<p><i>(Some tiny frozen plants.)</i></p>
<p><i>(They look healthy... Whoever took care of them before they got frozen did a good job.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="miraplant">Mirabelle's plant</h1>

<p><i>(A tiny dying plant.)</i></p>

<br>

<ul>

<ul>
  <li>"This plant looks like it's dying."</li>
  <li><b>Available only from the second time onward:</b> "This plant looks tiny and cute."</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>"This plant looks like it's dying."</h3>

<p><b>Bonnie (lol2):</b> It looks all pathetic!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> Very sad. Very mistreated. Who would do this.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> I-it's mine... I was taking a gardening class before the King attacked...</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>First time:</b> <i>(OOPS.)</i></li>

</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (huhwah1):</b> CRAB</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (zomg):</b> CRAB!!!</p>

<br>

<h3>"This plant looks tiny and cute."</h3>

<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> I guess?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> No it's not.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> No, no, I see what Sif means! There's a certain charm to it!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> It's cute. I hope it grows up to be big and strong.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> It better.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (stop!1):</b> You hear me, plant? I believe in yoU! Grow big and strong!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy4):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You smile.)</i></p>

<h4>Repeated interaction:</h4>
<p><i>(Mirabelle's tiny dying plant.)</i></p>

<h1 id="touch">Touch Therapy</h1>
<p><b>Full page:</b> <a href="/events/touchtherapy.html">Touch Therapy</a></p>
<p><i>When passing through all the way to where the items are, a small event plays out when passing by the tight spot by the table again.</i></p>

<h3>First time:</h3>

<p><i>(WOW there's no place to pass through with everyone following you.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You try your best to pass through the tight space between your [friends/allies/family members], the tables, and the wall.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Second time:</h3>
<p><i>(You try your best to pass through the tight space between your [friends/allies/family members], the tables, and the wall.)</i></p>
<p><i>(As you pass through, you realize, not for the first time in this situation, that everyone unconsciously makes sure to not touch you any more than necessary.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It's not the best feeling, but there must be a reason they're not touching you, so you leave it alone.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Third time:</h3>
<p><i>(While passing through, you stumble and accidentally bump against Odile.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You jump and yelp.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (huh1):</b> Woah!</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> Oh, sorry, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (awkward1):</b> "I, uh, I just wasn't--"</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Ha! Don't worry, you're good.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> We are used to your weird aversion to touch.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Your what?)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Fourth time:</h3>
<p><i>(Once again, you can tell that people make sure to give you some space.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Steeling yourself, you take a deep breath, and brush against everyone softly.)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(What a rush!)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Fifth time:</h3>
<p><i>(While passing through, you take a deep breath, and--)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (huhwah1):</b> Wah!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (blush3):</b> D-Don't poke my sides, Sif!!! I'm ticklish!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Oh, that's wonderful information to have.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You feel lightheaded.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Sixth time:</h3>
<p><i>(While passing through, you take a deep breath, and--)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> !</p>

<br>

<p><i>(As you gently poke her, she pokes you back.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Your cheeks feel warm.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Seventh time:</h3>

<p><i>(While passing through, you take a deep breath, and--)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (what2):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You quickly poked Odile's side.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Beyond throwing you a look, she doesn't react.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You try not to smile.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Eighth time:</h3>
<p><i>(While passing through, you take a deep breath, and--)</i></p>
<p><i>(Poke.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> Poke my cheek again and die.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Yep, message received.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You giggle under your breath.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Ninth time:</h3>
<p><i>The game forcefully keeps you at touch 9 if you are in ACT 2, meaning you cannot progress until ACT 3.</i></p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 2:</h4>
<p><i>(While passing through, you discreetly touch everyone.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You're getting better at this!)</i></p>

<h4>ACT 3 & 4:</h4>
<p><i>(As you pass through the tight space between the tables and the wall, you brush against everyone.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Touch touch touch touch.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You try to get some human contact every loop, even if it's discreetly like this.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Tenth time:</h3>
<p><i>(You brush against everyone again.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You've read somewhere that humans need a certain amount of skin-to-skin contact otherwise they go insane.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Asking for skin-to-skin contact would be weird, so you content yourself with clothes-to-clothes.)</i></p>
<p><i>(What do books know, anyway?)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Eleventh time:</h3>
<p><i>(Poke poke poke poke.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Poke!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(!)</i></p>
<p><i>(Without meaning to, you smile.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (sif!1):</b> !!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (awkward1):</b> Kids, please...</p>

<br>

<h3>Twelfth time onwards:</h3>

<p><i>(You poke everyone again, but this time no one reacts.)</i></p>
<p><i>(. . .)</i>

<br>

<h4>If Loop hasn't reassured Siffrin about this:</h4>
<p><i>(Someone, anyone...)</i></p>

<h4>If Loop has:</h4>
<p><i>(You're here.)</i></p>
