<p><i>The group enters the room and come to a stop in the middle. Mirabelle stands alone at the front of the group with her back to them.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Let's keep going!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (wait1):</b> Belle, wait a sec--</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm4):</b> Mira, wait!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> No!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>Mirabelle turns around toward the group.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (serious5):</b> I can't wait, we can't wait!!! We have to move on!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (yell1):</b> Everyone is waiting for me!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b> They can wait a little longer. Let's calm down and--</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (yell1):</b> I can't calm down!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad1):</b> The Head Housemaiden... She's so close! I can feel her! I need to help her!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad2):</b> She needs my help... Everyone in Vaugarde needs my help!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad3):</b> I... I...!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad4):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sad1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Odile (serious1):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<h4>First time:</h4>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You don't know what to do.)</i></p>
<p><i>(She's upset, she's upset, you need to help--)</i></p>

<h4>ACT 2:</h4>
<p><i>(You know it'll be fine, but you're still scared for her.)</i></p>

<h4>ACT 3:</h4>
<p><i>(Mirabelle...)</i></p>

<h4>ACT 4:</h4>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>Isabeau walks up to Mirabelle.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> Mira.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad2):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad3):</b> I...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Do it with me, okay?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> Just like Sif does!</p>

<br>

    <li><b>First time:</b> <i>(...?)</i></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> <i>(...)</i></li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (sad3):</b> Oh... Haha...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Isabeau takes a deep breath in, and out, and Mirabelle follows a beat later.)</i></p>
<p><i>(They breathe in sync, together.)</i></p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time:</b> <i>(...Ah. That is a thing that you do, yes.)</i></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> <i>(How many times have you done this for them to notice?)</i></li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (sad2):</b> Phew. . .</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (serious3):</b> I... I'm okay.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (serious4):</b> But Isabeau, you don't understand.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (serious4):</b> The Head Housemaiden... I have to save her...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad2):</b> The Head Housemaiden... She's such a wonderful person.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad2):</b> She helped me out so much! I couldn't do anything before I came to the House, I could barely sew my own clothes, and she helped me, she taught me...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad2):</b> I wouldn't be the person I am without her!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad2):</b> And when the King attacked... She protected me.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad2):</b> Everyone... Everyone was being frozen in time around me...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad4):</b> And the Head Housemaiden made sure I could escape! Made sure I lived!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad4):</b> She gave me her blessing...!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm4):</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk3):</b> Her blessing?</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> Do you mean... The power to survive the King's Curse? But wasn't that...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad3):</b> It wasn't the Change God...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad3):</b> The Change God rarely does anything.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad3):</b> The Change God just pushes us to greater heights, but rarely helps us themselves.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad3):</b> The KeyKnife we got earlier... It was the first time I felt their help...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad3):</b> But the Head Housemaiden Crafted a blessing so I'd survive. So I'd save her. Save everyone.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> But... Why? Why would she...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (yell1):</b> I DON'T KNOW WHY!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad4):</b> Why wouldn't she use it herself? Why didn't she save Vaugarde herself? Why didn't she give her blessing to someone else?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad3):</b> I don't know! I don't know!!! She shouldn't have used it... Not on someone like...!</p>

<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> I'm glad you're here, Mira.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> I'm glad you're here with us!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> Don't leave us behind! We're here! We want to help you!</p>

<p><b>Isabeau (happy1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Now it's m'dame Odile's turn to talk.</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> What? But you all were doing so well.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (gentle2):</b> I want an emotional speech from you too, madame Odile!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> Yeah, don't you see her tears? How can you say no to this face?</p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 2:</h4>
<p><i>(To prove Isabeau's point, you make a grand gesture towards Mirabelle as if presenting a marvelous art piece.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Isabeau does the same.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Bonnie also joins in.)</i></p>

<h4>ACT 3:</h4>
<p><i>(You, Isabeau and Bonnie point at Mirabelle and look at Odile silently.)</i></p>

<h4>ACT 4:</h4>
<p><i>(Without turning your head, you look at Odile silently.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Isabeau and Bonnie follow suit, with an exaggerated disappointed face.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(Mirabelle laughs, wiping her tears.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> Urgh okay fine please stop.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> Urgh.</p>
<p><b>Odile (serious4):</b> Okay. I think it's silly for you to wonder if you were the "right choice" this late in the game.</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> You're the one that was chosen. You're the one that found the Orbs. You're the one that made it this far.</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> So we can spend our very valuable time wondering if So-and-so could've saved Vaugarde better...</p>
<p><b>Odile (question2):</b> But we're here. You're here. And now, the King is the only thing standing in our way.</p>
<p><b>Odile (wry1):</b> So you can have your little breakdown after we kick him where it hurts and spit on his grave.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (oh1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (surprised1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (gentle2):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> M'dame, that was very good!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> A little too dry maybe. I'll give you an eight out of ten for effort.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (and then1):</b> That's a passing grade, Dile!</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> Shut up. I--</p>

<br>

<p><i>The sound of a stomach growling.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (oh!1):</b> Whose tummy is grumbling this time?</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (UWAH1):</b> DILE?!? YOU HAVE A TUMMY?!??!</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> Of course not.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Well, your not-tummy seems hungry. Bonbon?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (proud1):</b> Oh, I still have snacks!!! And they're ready now!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (happy1):</b> Can you eat something, Belle?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Yes, I can try.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (stop!1):</b> Okay then ALL OF YOU SIT THE CRAB DOWN!!!!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<h2 id="eventfriend">Friendquest variant</h2>

<p><i>Everybody walks into the room, stopping in the middle.</i></p>

<p><b>Bonnie (happy2):</b> Another safe room!</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm2):</b> Let's rest a bit, shall we? This might be our last chance to breathe...</p>

<br>

<p><i>Everybody sits down in a circle.</i></p>

<br>

<h4>First time:</h4>
<p><i>(You all quietly look Mirabelle's way, trying to make sure she's alright...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Will this be different somehow...?)</i></p>

<h4>Second time onwards:</h4>
<p><i>(Everyone quietly look Mirabelle's way, trying to make sure she's alright...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You've seen this before, but...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (serious1):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm5):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> Hey, hey, Mira, everything good?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Oh! Um, yes. I got a little fired up, fighting that big Sadness, earlier...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> But I feel better, now. I...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Hehehe, I'm doing breathing exercises! To stay calm!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> Ah yes, the fabled Siffrin breathing exercises.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> Told you he wasn't doing it for no reason! It had to help, somehow!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Hehehe! Yes!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> Thank you, Siffrin!</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time:</b> <i>(!)</i></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> <i>(...)</i></li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (haha1):</b> And thank you for yesterday, too! I don't think I'd be this calm if we hadn't talked...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (surprised1):</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm2):</b> Ah, when you two spent some time together.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy4):</b> Yes! We had a good talk... It helped me realize some things.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> Aw, I'm glad! Nothing like a good talk between friends to feel better!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> And it seems you were hard at work yesterday, weren't you, Siffrin? Helping me out, along with Bonnie and madame Odile...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (yeah!1):</b> And me!</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> Heh...</p>
<p><b>Odile (yeah1):</b> I suppose that's what friends are for, isn't it? To help with important things.</p>

<br>

<h4>First time:</h4>
<p><i>(Friends?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Are you all friends?)</i></p>
<p><i>(You traveled together, ate together, laughed together, so you thought it made you friends...)</i></p>
<p><i>(But Odile says the same thing every time, doesn't she?)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(It's pathetic, to come back here and hear the same thing over again.)</i></p>
<p><i>(But you need the reassurance.)</i></p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (sad2):</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (tired1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"Are we friends?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> Um, yes?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (angry3):</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (tired1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"But you said it once, didn't you, Odile?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (wait1):</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh3):</b> I--?</p>

<br>

<h4>First time:</h4>
<p><i>(You remember!)</i></p>
<p><i>(Every time you stop for a snack break on Floor 1!)</i></p>
<p><i>(She says, she says--)</i></p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry3):</b></p>

<br>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>
<p><i>(You know it's not the case, but you still have to say your lines.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You don't want to risk anything by changing the script, do you?)</i></p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b></p>

<br>

<p><i>Brief note: unlike the usual, the !/. change isn't tied to act number. "!" is for first time, "." is for subsequent times.</i></p>

<br>

<p>"You said we weren't friends[!/.]"</p>


<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (angry1):</b></li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (hide1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"You said we were allies! Colleagues at best[!/.]"</p>


<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> Hm?</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty2):</b> Did I...?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huh1):</b> Odile, how could you!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1):</b> I don't remember her saying that, but sadly, this does sound like something Odile would say.</p>

<br>

<h4>First time:</h4>
<p><i>(But she says it every time, every blinding time--)</i></p>
<p><i>(Wait.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Did she even say it, this loop?)</i></p>
<p><i>(When you stopped for a snack on the second floor... It was all different, so maybe it was different then, too...)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>
<p><i>(Because she does say it, most of the time.)</i></p>
<p><i>(But you don't care anymore.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You only care about now.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It's nice, to see them make sure you're not sad.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b> Allies...? I don't...</p>
<p><b>Odile (sigh1):</b> Well. That does sound like something I'd say, yes.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan2):</b> I... don't know if I consider you all friends, per se.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan1):</b> The five of us are just very different people, with different goals and thoughts. Our age difference makes it difficult for me to see you as "friends".</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> After all, why would an old lady be friends with a preteen?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sad1):</b> Oh...</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> It's just strange. So no, to me, we aren't friends. The mere thought is absurd to me.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (sad1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> Hm...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> Way to bring down the morale, m'dame...</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> I'm not done.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> I don't think we're friends, but...</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan3):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan3):</b> But I would do anything to protect all of you. Horrible things, to be honest, as long as I could be sure you were all safe.</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> And I think you'd all do the same for me. For anyone in our little group.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> So... So "friends" doesn't fit me, but. . .</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> But we're family, right?</p>

<br>

<h4>First time:</h4>
<p><i>(Huh?)</i>

<h4>ACT 3:</h4>
<p><i>(You try not to smile.)</i></p>

<h4>ACT 4:</h4>
<p><i>(You try not to cry.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (and then1):</b> YEAH!!! WE'RE FAMILY!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (yeah!2):</b> "Like me and Nille! We stay together! WE eat together! We say good morning and good night!</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> Family...</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm2):</b> I have a difficult relationship with that word, but...</p>
<p><b>Odile (yeah1):</b> Yes, "family" fits better, I think.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Family! What a lovely word to describe our relationship to each other!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> I already thought of us like that, but it's kind of awkward to say it aloud, isn't it?</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> It is, a little bit. But we don't know what tomorrow, or even the next few hours have in store...</p>
<p><b>Odile (yeah1):</b> So while we are still together on this journey, we might as well say it. Say the unsaid.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Especially since Siffrin over here seemed to think I didn't care about him.</p>

<br>

<h4>First time:</h4>
<p><i>(You don't know how to react.)</i></p>
<p><i>(All this time... You were trying to keep in mind what she said.)</i></p>
<p><i>(That you were just... Allies, to each other.)</i></p>
<p><i>(But...)</i></p>
<p><i>(. . .)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>
<p><i>(You hide your face under the rim of your hat.)"</i></p>
<p><i>(You don't want to think about anything.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>After reaching the end with all Friendquests done once:</h4>
<p><i>(You still think it's the truth, to be honest.)</i></p>
<p><i>(This isn't real.)</i></p>
<p><i>(No, it is, it is! It's real!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You're standing here right now, in front of them, they exist, you exist.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Just because you know what happens next doesn't mean it's not real.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It is. It is real.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b> . . .</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Odile reaches over and ruffles your hair.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (gentle1):</b> Don't think so hard, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> Quite honestly, it doesn't seem to work out very well for you.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (lol2):</b> Heheheh!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> So mean, m'dame.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Hehe, Siffrin's hat is all lopsided now!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (lol2):</b> You look funny like this, Frin!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You readjust your hat, and hide your face.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> Heh.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(They all look at you, smiling.)</i>
<p><i>(. . .)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> I'm bored.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie (and then1):</b> SNACK TIME!!!</p>


<h1 id="snacks">Snack Time</h1>
<p><i>Sections that change if you've reached the end with all Friendquests done in the same loop once will be referred to with "With FQ" for short, but you know what I mean, right?</i></p>

<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> Um, I'll start with the worst one.</p>

<img src="https://felicitations.neocities.org/images/samosas.png" alt="Bonnie holding up three burnt samosas.">

<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> Leftover samosas.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> From yesterday's dinner?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sad1):</b> Yeah... They're the ones I burnt...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> But I thought I should still keep them in case we get super duper hungry.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Don't be mean to the burnt samosas, they were delicious!</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> They really were. They're not the "worst" of anything.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> And, um, the last snack...</p>

<h3>First time</h3>

<p><b>Bonnie (surprised1):</b> Okay, I've never tried it before, but--</p>
