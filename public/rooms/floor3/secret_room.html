    <li><b>ACT 2:</b> <i>(Not your thing, but you don't mind them!)</i></li>
    <li><b>ACt 3-4:</b><i> (You try not to cringe.)</i></li>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> Romance novels...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (yeah!1):</b> Romance!!! Novels!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (ew1):</b> Ew.</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> Urgh...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> I understand the kid's reaction, but why "urgh", m'dame?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> Don't sound so disgusted, madame!!! Romance novels are good!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> Eh...</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading2):</b> I'm just the kind of person who has decided romantic love is not very important to me, Mirabelle.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> ...!</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>Default:</b> <i>(Mirabelle is looking at Odile intently...)</i></li>
    <li><b>With Mirabelle's Friendquest done in the same loop:</b> <i>(Mirabelle looks your way, with stars in her eyes.)</i></li>
    <li><b>With Mirabelle's Friendquest done in a previous loop:</b> <i>(You look Mirabelle's way, but she only has eyes for Odile.)</i></li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Ha-have you...Have you never been in love before, madame Odile?"</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh3)</b> Huh? Oh, no, of course I've been in love before.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> It'd be weirder if I didn't, at my age.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad1):</b> O-Oh...</p>
<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> Hm... I did fall in love for the first time later than most... Maybe in my twenties?</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading2):</b> And even then, it took me a while to realize what I was feeling.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> Oh yeah? Why is that?</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> At the time, I genuinely didn't know you could get crushes on people you hate, heh.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (LMAO1):</b> HA! YEAH!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> What? That's weird.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> Wait, HUH?!? IS THAT TRUE?!?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huh1):</b> Um, yes?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> Crushes can be annoying like that.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> My heart has been good to me though, so it hasn't happened to me in a long time!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> HUH!?!?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Why are you so surprised? You recommended me a romance novel that was about bitter enemies becoming lovers!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> A-AND I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY THEY WOULD DO THAT BUT THE STORY WAS WELL WRITTEN AND INTERESTING AND I JUST FIGURED IT WAS THEM BEING WEIRD!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> But...Isn't there a whole genre of romance books about... Enemies becoming lovers?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> I THOUGHT IT WAS A LOVE TROPE THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY BASIS IN REALITY JUST LIKE HOW YOUR HEART DOESN'T ACTUALLY BEAT FASTER WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE YOU LIKE!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (oh1):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Isabeau puts a hand on Mirabelle's shoulder.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> Conversations like these are why I hope we'll stay friends for a very long time, Mira.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Oh! Isabeau, I'm so glad, I feel the sa--</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> WAIT, NO--</p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 2:</h4>
<p><i>(Wait, can you not choose who you get a crush on? It just happens?)</i></p>
<p><i>(This explains so much!!!)</i></p>

<h4>ACT 3-4:</h4>
<p><i>(Crushes feel like a disease to you, sometimes.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You want to tear those feelings out.)</i></p>

<h4>If You Know:</h4> 
<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(He probably can't help having a crush on you.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Poor him. He deserves better.)</i></p>

<h2 id="letter">Letter</h2>

<p><i>(It's a letter addressed to the writer's mother.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You skim through it...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Sounds like someone ran away from home and had to reassure their mother they were doing okay.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (oh1):</b> Drama!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (stop!1)</b> They ran away from home?! Why would they do that?!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (wait1):</b> Home is where the snacks are!</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> And also, family.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> And also, family.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> You've never ran away from home, Bonbon? I'll have to take back that cool kid certificate from you.</p>

<h3 id="default">Default dialogue</h3>

<p><b>Odile (reading2):</b> Anyway, people who run away from home are... People who don't like their family, maybe.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Um, sometimes parents can be meanies, and someone might decide to just... Leave?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (surprised1):</b> Oh... You can run away from home if your parents are meanies?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (and then1):</b> Oh! That's what Nille did! I think!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Nille...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (happy2):</b> My sister! I think she told me about it once.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (smile4):</b> But I wasn't listening very well because I was sleepy.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Oh?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm4):</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(No one really knows how to respond to that.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (wai1):</b> Huh? What? What? What did I say?</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> N-Nothing at all, Boniface. Should we look at something other than an old letter?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (and then1):</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Isabeau (oh1):</b> Woah!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> You did?!?</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Tell us more, cool kid.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Wh-what was the reason why?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fufu1):</b> <i>(You don't even have to think about it.)</i> "I just didn't want to eat my veggies."</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> ...Huh.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (smiling3):</b> "And so I took our boat!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (questions2):</b> "Got to the beach, rowed away from the shore a bit."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (joke1):</b> "I was going to come back right away, I just wanted to scare my parents a bit!"</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> Such a terrible child.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> A-And then, and then? What happened when you got back?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (smiling3):</b> "I started to row back towards the shore..."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (questions1):</b> "And then, I..."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (surprised3):</b> "I..."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (surprised1):</b> "..."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder1):</b> ...Sif?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (surprised2):</b> <i>(Woah! What?)</i> "Um, yes?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huh1):</b> Um... You were telling us how you ran away from home?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (questions1):</b> "I... was?"</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> You... Were.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (stop!1):</b> DID YOU FORGET WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WHILE TALKING ABOUT IT?!?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Seriously Sif, we have GOT to do something about your awful memory.</p>
