<h1 id="enter">Entering</h1>

<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> Oh!!!! That's...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> That's... that's my room...</p>

<br>

<h1 id="books">Bookshelf</h1>

<p>(Horror books.)</p>
<p>(There's "The Cursing of Ch√¢teau Castle" issue #68, "Death Die Dice Maker", "One Hundred Ways to Die Horribly", "The Meat Slicing"...)</p>
<p>(Ah. That last one's actually a cooking book.)</p>

<br>

<h4>After speaking to the Castle-loving One:</h4>
<p>(...Issue #68? You should remember this number.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (isthatso1):</b> A lot of horror books in there. Is this one about a group of young adults being forced to kill each other for someone's entertainment?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> It is!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading2):</b> Hm...</p>

<br>

<h3>If Mirabelle and Odile promised to hold a book club:</h3>
<p>By interacting with the book of horror novels in the <a href="/rooms/floor3/writing_room.html">Writing Room</a>.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> Again, give me your recommendations at some point.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> I will!!!</p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 2:</h4>
<p>(You laugh quietly.)</p>
<p>(You hope they get to have their book club soon.)</p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 3:</h4>
<p>(You smile.)</p>
<p>(Some things stay the same.)</p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 4:</h4>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h3>If they haven't:</h3>

<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> We should have a book club sometime, just the two of us.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> We should!!! We could exchange letters and recommendations after we beat the King!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Whaaaaat, just you two? The rest of us aren't invited?</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> No. Girls only.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Yeah, back off, Isabeau!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> Being told to back off by Mirabelle herself... I feel blessed somehow.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> Yes, um... What gave it away?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (happy1):</b> It smells fruity, just like your name!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (and then1):</b> <span class="shake">MIRABELLE PLUMS!!!</span></p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Hehehe! My roommate gifted me some mirabelle plums scented soap a while back!</p>

<br>

<h4>If you haven't looked at Claude's bed:</h4>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy4):</b> She may never clean her room and she may keep me from sleeping by muttering formulas to herself in the middle of the night, but she does give great gifts.</p>

<br>

<h4>If you've looked at Claude's bed:</h4>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad1):</b> She may never clean her room and she may keep me from sleeping by muttering formulas to herself in the middle of the night, but she... does give great gifts...</p>
