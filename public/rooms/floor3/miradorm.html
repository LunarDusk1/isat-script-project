<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> Oh!!!! That's...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> That's... that's my room...</p>

<br>

<h1 id="books">Bookshelf</h1>

<p><i>(Horror books.)</i></p>
<p><i>(There's "The Cursing of Ch√¢teau Castle" issue #68, "Death Die Dice Maker", "One Hundred Ways to Die Horribly", "The Meat Slicing"...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Ah. That last one's actually a cooking book.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>After speaking to the Castle-loving One:</h4>
<p><i>(...Issue #68? You should remember this number.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (isthatso1):</b> A lot of horror books in there. Is this one about a group of young adults being forced to kill each other for someone's entertainment?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> It is!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading2):</b> Hm...</p>

<br>

<h3>If Mirabelle and Odile promised to hold a book club:</h3>
<p><i>By interacting with the book of horror novels in the <a href="/rooms/floor3/writing_room.html">Writing Room</a>.</i></p>

<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> Again, give me your recommendations at some point.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> I will!!!</p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 2:</h4>
<p><i>(You laugh quietly.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You hope they get to have their book club soon.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 3:</h4>
<p><i>(You smile.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Some things stay the same.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 4:</h4>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>If they haven't:</h3>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> We should have a book club sometime, just the two of us.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> We should!!! We could exchange letters and recommendations after we beat the King!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Whaaaaat, just you two? The rest of us aren't invited?</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> No. Girls only.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Yeah, back off, Isabeau!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> Being told to back off by Mirabelle herself... I feel blessed somehow.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> Yes, um... What gave it away?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (happy1):</b> It smells fruity, just like your name!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (and then1):</b> MIRABELLE PLUMS!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Hehehe! My roommate gifted me some mirabelle plums scented soap a while back!</p>

<br>

<h4>If you haven't looked at Claude's bed:</h4>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy4):</b> She may never clean her room and she may keep me from sleeping by muttering formulas to herself in the middle of the night, but she does give great gifts.</p>

<br>

<h4>If you've looked at Claude's bed:</h4>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad1):</b> She may never clean her room and she may keep me from sleeping by muttering formulas to herself in the middle of the night, but she... does give great gifts...</p>

<p><i>(You open the drawer.)</i></p>
<p><i>(There's some pens, a brooch, anti-anxiety medication...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...And some papers.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Each paper seems to be a file about a different person...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Each has a picture of someone, their name, and what seems to be their answers to questions like "Where do you imagine yourself in ten years?" and "Do you want kids?")</i></p>
<p><i>(What are those papers...? She must've been looking at similar papers in Dormont. Is she choosing one person to do something...?)</i></p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> She doesn't clean her side of her room ever, and she leaves her experiments and weird potions around everywhere, and she always sings way too loud!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (serious3):</b> And when I ask her to maybe change songs and sing something I might like, she always tells me "No can do, princess"!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> She's mean and has no respect towards others!!!</p>

<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> Hahaha!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> I'm just saying. She has the materials to make a Craft bomb.</p>
