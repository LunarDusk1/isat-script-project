<h1 id="act2">ACT 2</h1>

<br>

<h2 id="first">First time</h2>

<p><i>(You close the bathroom stall door.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You don't really need to go, but there is something you need to do, away from everyone...)</i></p>

<p><i>(You fistbump the air and whisper yell yes, yes, yes under your breath.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Yes!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're all doing it!!! You're all getting so close to the King!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(And it's all thanks to you and this blessing!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Whoever, whatever blessed you with this, thank you, you think!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Whether it's the Universe, the Change God, that tree, the stars, the moon, anyone, thank you!!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Ah, stars, can you imagine if you only had one life? You'd have died right at the start!)</i></p>

<p><i>(And if not then, one of you might've been frozen in time forever by touching one of those tears because you're all a bunch of curious idiots!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Or worse, any of you could've died against a Sadness for good!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(But you have this power! This Craft! You'll never die for good! You'll always be able to start again!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(You quietly jump in place with a big grin on your face.)</i></p>

<p><i>(One, two, three, four jumps!)</i></p>

<p><i>(You jump a final time, out of breath, and try to take a deep breath in, and out.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Phew.......)</i></p>

<p><i>(Alright.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're so close to the King, you can almost taste it. You need to stay focused.)</i></p>

<p><i>(...Or do you? You can always loop back, start over, make sure nothing bad happens to you or the people you care about!)</i></p>

<p><i>(The King will never know what hit him.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You fistbump the air one final time for good measure.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You exit the bathroom.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="no_shield">After dying to the King without finding Adorable Moving Shield</h2>

<p><i>(You close the bathroom stall door.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Well. That didn't go as well as you'd hoped.)</i></p>

<p><i>(The King is much stronger than you thought, isn't he...?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Or, well. He might be strong, but maybe he'll be easy to defeat once you manage to survive his first strike.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Not like you had much time to try things out.)</i></p>

<p><i>(...One hit, huh...)</i></p>

<p><i>(What his attack did... Yes, it hit hard, but you saw something when he attacked.)</i></p>

<p><i>(A vision.)</i></p>

<p><i>(The vision was so powerful, it alone might've been enough to knock you out.)</i></p>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<p><i>(How can you get past his first attack? That's what you have to figure out right now.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You don't want to die against him again. More importantly, you don't want to see everyone defeated.)</i></p>

<p><i>(...They died soon after you did, didn't they? They must've. Bonnie might've been able to escape, but none of you could do anything.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Does a loop go on, after you die...?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Maybe time stops, and rewinds back with you?)</i></p>

<p><i>(So they didn't actually die?)</i></p>

<p><i>(It must be how it works.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You can't imagine that time continues after you die. That's the whole point of this time loop thing, isn't it? Time goes with you?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Yes. As long as you die before your allies, they're okay.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're okay.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Alright... You have to find a way to protect yourself against the King.)</i></p>

<p><i>(That's your first priority, and then, you get endless tries to defeat the King!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Thanks Universe, Change God, someone, anyone! Thank you for this blessing!)</i></p>

<p><i>(You'll be okay.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You exit the bathroom.)</i></p>

<br>


<h2 id="shield">After obtaining Adorable Moving Shield</h2>

<p><i>(You close the bathroom stall door.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Well, you have a way to defend yourself against the King, but you're still having trouble, aren't you?)</i></p>

<p><i>(The King is so much stronger than you anticipated.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Why is he so powerful? What made him this way?)</i></p>

<p><i>(You've seen him a couple times, now. A couple more, and you might know his opening dialogue by heart.)</i></p>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<p><i>(He keeps asking... if you remember.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Remember what?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Is there something you've forgotten, that he knows about? Does it have something to do with the loops, perhaps?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Does he remember you?)</i></p>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<p><i>(Doesn't matter right now. You just need to find a way to beat him.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Maybe you could find ways to get stronger inside the House? Battle more Sadnesses?)</i></p>

<p><i>(That KeyKnife you got... If you managed to keep it intact, it might help you against the King.)</i></p>

<p><i>(And tonics, can't forget tonics... If you went from the first floor of the House and walked all the way to the top, picking up items as you went through, it might help you survive a little bit longer.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Just a tiny bit more.)</i></p>

<p><i>(One hit more, one hit more, until you win.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Endless tries.)</i></p>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<p><i>(Thanks Universe, Change God, someone, anyone. Thank you for this blessing.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You'll be okay.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You exit the bathroom.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="act3">ACT 3</h1>

<br>

<h2 id="early3">Early ACT 3</h2>

<p><i>(You close the bathroom stall door, and sit on the dirty floor.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You breathe out, slowly.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Okay.)</i></p>

<p><i>(So, you're trapped in time, and that's not great.)</i></p>

<p><i>(But you have goals you can strive towards, so you're fine.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You know what to do.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Help your friends, find out more about the loops, talk to the King.)</i></p>

<p><i>(As long as you have goals, you will be fine.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Why did you loop back?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Why isn't it over?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Why did it even start in the first place?)</i></p>

<p><i>(It was na√Øve, to not even think about why you're even looping.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You got the power to help everyone, and you just accepted it?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Who did you think you were? The hero of this story?)</i></p>

<p><i>(That was silly.)</i></p>

<p><i>(If only you'd used your brain sooner, maybe you wouldn't be in this situation.)</i></p>

<p><i>(If only you'd thought about why you got those powers.)</i></p>

<p><i>(If you'd looked inside the classroom more attentively.)</i></p>

<p><i>(If you'd searched the Head Housemaiden's office better.)</i></p>

<p><i>(If you'd looked closer at the pillar in the Death Corridor.)</i></p>

<p><i>(What are you missing now, that you'll feel stupid for not seeing earlier?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Stupid.)</i></p>

<p><i>(But it's fine. You're seeing clearly, now.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You won't miss a thing anymore.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You'll save everyone, save Vaugarde, and escape from this loop.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You will.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You exit the bathroom.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="family1">First family run</h2>

<p><i>(You close the bathroom stall door.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You like coming here, because you know you'll be able to be alone for a bit...)</i></p>

<p><i>(But... You almost feel like going outside right away, right now.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Huh!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Why?)</i></p>

<p><i>(You feel weird.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Even though you're stuck in this time loop, and you don't know how to escape yet...)</i></p>

<p><i>(You feel happy?)</i></p>

<p><i>(You feel happy!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Why do you feel happy?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Is it because you're helping everyone, right now? Hearing them out, helping them with their problems?)</i></p>

<p><i>(You talked to each one of them. Learned more about them as people. Talked about things with them you've never talked about with anyone.)</i></p>

<p><i>(It was embarrassing, a bit, but it made you feel so warm.)</i></p>

<p><i>(It was nice.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Even though you're not friends.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Even though you're just allies.)</i></p>

<p><i>(But that's how you become closer to people, right? By helping them out?)</i></p>

<p><i>(So maybe right now, they like you better than in previous loops, because you helped them!)</i></p>

<p><i>(And, and... Okay, this will sound silly...)</i></p>

<p><i>(But maybe that's all you need?)</i></p>

<p><i>(To break the loop?)</i></p>

<p><i>(That's stupid.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're stupid. Don't even think about it, or it won't come true.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You smack the side of your head, focusing on the pain.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Stay focused!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Stop thinking about best case scenarios, stop thinking about your allies, stop thinking about how they don't see you as a friend or anything, stop thinking, stop it, stop it.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You breathe slowly in, and out, and think about nothing.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You exit the bathroom.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="family2">Subsequent family runs</h2>

<p><i>(You close the bathroom stall door.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Once again, you find yourself here.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Helping your family members be the best version of themselves.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Mirabelle, who's starting to accept her unchanging self.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Odile, who's learning more about her history.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Bonnie, who's starting to understand they were never, ever at fault.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Isabeau, who just wanted to talk to you.)</i></p>

<p><i>(It's the same as before, isn't it?)</i></p>

<p><i>(This is as far as their change goes.)</i></p>

<p><i>(They will never change more than they do now.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Worse: you won't let them.)</i></p>

<p><i>(But it's comforting, isn't it? It's nice, isn't it?)</i></p>

<p><i>(You could do this forever, and it wouldn't be so bad, wouldn't it?)</i></p>

<p><i>(You used to think it would be perfect, to remember everything that happened to you.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You don't think you were right, but it's nice, still.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You'll remember it all, now. You won't forget a thing.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Even if you're the only one who remembers this time, you're fine.)</i></p>

<p><i>(It's better than the alternative, isn't it?)</i></p>

<p><i>(It's fine, it's fine.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're fine.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You exit the bathroom.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2 id="kingquest">During Kingquest</h2>
<p><i>For the details of what Kingquest is, see <a href="/acts/act3-4/kingquest.html">Kingquest</a>.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(You close the bathroom stall door.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You clench and unclench your fists, not knowing what to do with yourself.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You try not to breathe too loudly.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Sometimes you feel so much anger.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Why do they not remember? Why are you the only one living like this?)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're the only one living and knowing and experiencing the same moments over and over again.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Why is it just you? Why shouldn't everyone feel this pain?!?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Why should you be the only one stuck here when you've done nothing wrong?!?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Is this some kind of curse?)</i></p>

<p><i>(You always felt awful about not remembering, and now you have to live your life, knowing you're the only one who remembers this time?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Remembering every single moment, every single sentence, every single battle, wound, death, everyone unaware?!?)</i></p>

<p><i>(You grab fistfuls of your hair and tug!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(It's not fair!!! It's not fair, not fair, not fair, it's not!!! Fair!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(You want it all to be over!!! This loop, this life!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're caught between a sequence of life and death and life again, going through the motions until the next time the loop restarts!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(It's torture!!! Every second of it!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(And everyone is acting like nothing's wrong!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Why do they get to ignore it?! Get to keep acting, like actors in a play they don't know the ending to?!?)</i></p>

<p><i>(You hate them all!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Your [allies/family members]</i></p>

<p><i>the whole country,</i></p>

<p><i>the whole world should know this pain!!!!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD SUFFER AS YOU HAVE SUFFERED!!!!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<p><i>(Sometimes you understand the King more than you'd like to.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You breathe out, trying to keep your anger close to your body.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You'll shake from it, but it's fine.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You dust yourself off, and exit the bathroom.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="act4">ACT 4</h1>

<p><i>(You close the bathroom stall door, and inhale sharply.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Oh no~! That was too loud, someone might hear you~!!! Try again.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Your eye stings.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Your stomach hurts.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Your head feels like it's about to split in two.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You try to breathe silently, in, and out, but it won't go in, or out--)</i></p>

<p><i>(Oh!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Do you want to cry? Is that it?)</i></p>

<p><i>(Oh yeah! You've always thought crying was just a waste of time, but you remember reading once that just the act of crying DOES help making you feel better!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Okay then!!! Tears, come on out~!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(No tears are coming out!!! Okay!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Hahaha!!! Sounds like you don't want to cry right now after all!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Stars!!! You're finally someplace no one will see you, you spent this whole loop wanting to cry, and now that you're safe and hidden, the tears won't come?!?)</i></p>

<p><i>(You won't get a chance to be alone for a while! You need to cry now! Stars!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(You can't cry from your dead eye, but you should be able to cry from the other, can't you?!? Or are you broken on both blinding sides!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Just cry, stupid body!!! Cry!!!!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Your nose burns and your eye stings but no tears are coming out.)</i></p>

<p><i>(It's not working!!! This is a losing battle!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Oh!!! Maybe pain will do the trick? That's why people usually cry, right?)</i></p>

<p><i>(You put a finger in your mouth and bite as hard as you can.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Nope, not working.)</i></p>

<p><i>(It's apparently not time to cry yet!!!!!! Hahahahahaha!!!!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Okay, stop, stop, stop, and calm down. You're fine.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're fine.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You just need to keep going.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You have to find out more about how the loops work. That's the only path you have left!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Learn more about the loops, about why you're here, about why the loop breaks down when you talk to the Head Housemaiden.)</i></p>

<p><i>(And act better!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Your family members... You can tell they feel something's wrong, you need to get your act together.)</i></p>

<p><i>(If they know something's wrong, it'll only get harder for you.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Especially if she knows.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Especially if...)</i></p>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<p><i>(The... The tall one, with the glasses... The Researcher, she...)</i></p>

<p><i>(She's the coldest, but she can get so curious sometimes it makes her seem almost childish, she's too perceptive for her own good, and you--)</i></p>

<p><i>(You can't... Remember... Her name...!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>Someone knocks on the door.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Siffrin, are you okay? You've been in there a while.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(OH!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(ODILE!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "ODILE!"</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> ...! Yes?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Odile.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> Odile.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> That is my name, yes.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> ...Is everything--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(There's no toilet paper in this stall.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> There's no toilet paper in this stall.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> HA!</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> I'll go and get you some. Give me a second.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You hear her walk away.)</i></p>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<p><i>(Odile. Mirabelle. Isabeau. Bonnie.)</i></p>

<p><i>(It's okay, you remember. You still remember.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You bite your gloved fingers, and try to breathe deeply, in, and out.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You remember. You haven't forgotten them. They're still here. Traveling together with you. You're still here.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're okay. You're okay.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're okay.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(You flinch.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Something fell on your lap.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile:</b> I found you some paper, Siffrin.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Thank you, Odile.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "Thank you, Odile."</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Hn. See you in a second.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You hear her walk away.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You take the toilet paper, and hold it between your hands.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You press your face against it, breathing.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Thinking about nothing.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Wow, this toilet paper is really nice and soft, actually.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You wonder where she found it.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Teehee!)</i></p>

<p><i>(See? Even stuck in a time loop, and even though you've been stuck for a long time, there are still things you can find out about the world around you.)</i></p>

<p><i>(This roll of toilet paper is giving you hope!)</i></p>

<p><i>(HOW BLINDINGLY WONDERFUL, FOR A ROLL OF TOILET PAPER TO BE THE ONLY HOPE YOU HAVE LEFT RIGHT NOW!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(You exit the stall.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="act5">ACT 5</h1>

<p><i>You must attempt to enter the bathroom multiple times for this to occur.</i></p>

<p><i>(Enough monologuing.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Enough monologuing!)</i></p>

<p><i>(Urgh!!! Fine!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(You know you can get a little obsessed with monologues sometimes, but a little spiralling never hurt nobody!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're sad.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're alone.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Everyone left you behind because you're such a horrible terrible disgusting person you thought it'd be fine to make them get cool skills faster.)</i></p>

<p><i>(As if they were nothing more than characters in a play.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Because that's what they are at this point, aren't they? That's what they've been to you, since you managed to beat the King.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You won't let them be anything else.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Because otherwise you'll have to deal with the fact that because of this loop, you are denying them agency, change, a future.)</i></p>

<p><i>(But it's not your fault, is it? That you're stuck here? So why do you have to deal with anything?)</i></p>

<p><i>(But you feel like it's your fault, because you've wished for something like this for a while, haven't you?)</i></p>

<p><i>(A chance to always remember your adventures with them.)</i></p>

<p><i>(To continue.)</i></p>

<p><i>(For--)</i></p>

<p><i>(End of monologue.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="exhausted">Exhausted monologues</h1>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> --And I just feel like I'm not helping, I dunno.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I'm not useful at all.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurgh. Okay.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> What should you do if someone's defense is lowered?</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...Jump around and help them build back their defenses...</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> What if their health is low?</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I have snacks... And I know everyone's favorites...</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> And if you get an opening?</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Throw a rock at the enemy, distract them, that sort of stuff.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> See? That seems pretty useful to me.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> It's not--</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> It is, Boniface. Just because you're not fighting with us doesn't mean you're not a valuable member of this team.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> ...We were all split about this, but we all agreed to bring you with us to fight the King, because at the time we thought this would be the best way to keep you safe from the Curse.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> But, if you'd rather we bring you back to Dormont--</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> NO!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> No, you can't! I'm coming! It's too late! I'm staying with you guys!!!</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Good. Only strong useful allies can come, anyway.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Hehehe!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Hey wait, the way back is blocked anyway! You can't bring me back to Dormont even if you wanted!</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> We could throw you out a window.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> NO?!?</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...Belle...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Yes?</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Can I have a hug?</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> 'M sorry, I promise I won't hug you long, I just, um--</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Oh, oh sweetheart, come here...</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Oh Bonnie, you're doing such an amazing job helping us. You're so brave.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> It must be so scary for you...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> I'm really proud of you, you know?</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> With you by our side, I'm sure we'll be able to save your sister soon!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Mmm... I dunno...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> I do know! I-I'm the Change God's chosen, after all!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> And so I know that everything will be fine!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...Can you stop squeezing my head so hard though...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Ah! S-sorry!!!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> I-sa-beau~</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Heh! How you holding up, Mira?</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> M-me? I'm, uh, okay...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> ...Well, no, I'm not... But it'd be useless to think about all the ways I'm not okay right now.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Hm...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> What about you, Isabeau?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Huh? Me?</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Yes, you! You, um. You've been with me since the start, you know?</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> If you didn't agree to come with me when I ran to Jouvente for help, I probably wouldn't have gotten this far... And I wouldn't have met everyone else, too!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> You always made sure I'm okay, and even now you keep everyone going by making sure we're doing fine, but... I just wanted to make sure that... That you were okay, too...</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I'm a pretty simple guy, Mira! I don't have a big enough brain to worry about things!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Isabeau...</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Oh, not convincing enough? Eeeeh...</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I'm good, Mira. Making sure everyone is okay makes me feel better, you know!</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> So as long as you tell me if you need any help, I'm okay!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Is it that simple...?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> It's that simple!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Aw crab, Mira, just come here already.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Oh, wow... I didn't think I needed a hug this badly... Sorry...</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Nothing like a big strong man hugging your worries away, huh?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Ha, funny, I think I really needed a hug too...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Hehehe!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> You know, I love you, Isabeau!</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> And I love you, Mira!!!</p>

<p><i>(You hear a smack.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Then another smack.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Then multiple smacks, like two people slapping each other repeatedly.)</i></p>

<p><i>(And then--)</i></p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Stop, stop, stop, I yield, I yield!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> NYEHEHEH!!!</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> How can such a small hand do that much damage...</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I don't have small hands, shut up!!!</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> You sure do, look!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> WHY IS YOUR HAND SO BIG?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Adult privileges. And also, I Crafted my body to have big hands.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> But hey, Bonbon, how are you doing? Doing okay? Want a snack? Want a hug?</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> If I want a snack I'll eat one, if I want a hug I'll get one. From Belle and not you.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Good! And how are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I...</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I want a ride on your shoulders.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Ha, okay!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...I'm so tall now.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> You are.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I can touch the top of the wall if I wanted.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Do it.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Crab yeah.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You think everyone will be fine if we beat the King?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Even my sister?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Even Belle?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> For sure.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Even Dile?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Even Frin?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Without a doubt.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> And you too?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Of course.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You promise?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I super duper promise.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Pat, pat.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Huh, huh, what?!?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Oh!!! I was trying to pat your head. Where's your head? Is that your head?</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Not here, that's my chin.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Is it here?</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> No, that's my ears.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> It HAS to be here.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> No, that's my nose!!! Hehehe!!!</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Look, my head is here.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> There we go.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Pat, pat, pat.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Now get me down, you're too tall, it's weird.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Maybe you're just too small, Bonbon.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Maybe. But one day, I'll be taller than you.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> And YOU'll be the one getting a ride on my shoulders.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I would love nothing more, Bonbon.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Something wrong, m'dame? You're frowning.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Siffrin is acting strange.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Huuuuh? You think so? But strange how?</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> This crush of yours shouldn't make you this stupid, Isabeau.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Yeah, Sif's acting weird.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Since yesterday.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> But isn't that normal? To be acting weird?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> We're all... pretty stressed out, aren't we?</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> ...Don't do anything stupid, Odile.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Better to at least do something, rather than watching things happen and hoping for the best, Isabeau.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> ...Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> I'll wait until after we beat the King to talk to Siffrin.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> In the meantime, let me know if you notice anything.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Uh huh, uh huh, thank you for this impromptu lesson, m'dame. Very sorely needed.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Urgh. See if I give you more stunning advice next time, Isabeau.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Aw!!!</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> ...Remember when you thought Sif was an assassin sent by the King to kill Mira?</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Don't remind me. I was drunk. I can't be held responsible.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I miss drunk Odile... She has the best theories...</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Shut your mouth. I will never allow her to come out again.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Not after last time.</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Oh, last time...</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> It's too bad I was the only one still awake. I'll remember last time for the rest of my days. I'm keeping that story for a rainy--</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Stop talking.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Or would you rather we talk about the time you were so drunk you--</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> NO IT'S FINE SORRY I'M SORRY M'DAME SHUSH!!!! Sif could come out at any--</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Mirabelle, how are you doing?</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> ...! If it's okay with you, madame...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> I just want to talk about anything other than how I'm doing right now.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Of course.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> ...! What about you, madame?</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Oh, I'm not fine at all, but what can we do about it.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> No matter what happens, the next few hours will solve all my problems.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> One way or another.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Hnrgh...</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> So.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> You may not know this, but in some countries, two women together would be expected to talk about men, and love, and nothing else.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Would you like to talk about the men in our lives, and love, and nothing else?</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> We've only got the one man, madame.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> And also, ew.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Ha!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Hehehe!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> But, you know... Anything to get our minds off things.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Quite right. But speaking of the one man in our lives...</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Do you think Isabeau will finally do it?</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Do what?</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Confess.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Confess?</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> To whomst?</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> ...Mirabelle.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> To whomst?</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> ...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH?!?!?!?! OH CHANGE?!??!??!!</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Mirabelle.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS?!??!!</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Mirabelle.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> OH CHANGE!!!! BUT IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE!!!!!!!</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Mirabelle-- Pft, hahaha--</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON?!</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Weeks! Me and Boniface have been placing bets.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Boniface gets a piggyback ride from me if Isabeau confesses before we beat the King.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> I get a full course meal if he confesses after.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> What? Bonnie will definitely lose. Isabeau would only confess after.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> It's the most romantic option!</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> That's what I said. He is a very romantic lad.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> He is!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Oh, I can't believe I didn't notice. I feel very stupid.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Why didn't he tell me! I could've helped!!!</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> I did ask him why he wouldn't talk to you about it instead of bothering me with his woes, and he said something like...</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Mira likes romance books, but I think talking about actual real life romance makes her uncomfortable.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Oh...</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> W-Well, that's true, but Isabeau is my friend!!! My romance book friend!!!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> I should be the only one he'd talk to about this, and no one else!!!</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> I think he'd like that. To talk about it with you, I mean.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> He didn't want to bother you with it, but I think he wanted to. You should talk to him.</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> So he doesn't have to talk to me.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> I'm surprised, madame. I thought you liked gossip, hehehe!</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> No one can know I love to gossip, Mirabelle.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Hehehe! I'll never tell!!!</p>
