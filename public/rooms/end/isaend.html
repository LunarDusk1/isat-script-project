<br>

<h4>Always:</h4>
<p><b>Isabeau (sif!1):</b> Sif!!! We did it!!!</p>

<br>

<h4>Less than five times:</h4>
<p><b>Isabeau (yeah!1):</b> We did it, Sif, we did it! We did it! We stopped the King! We can finally go back to our normal lives! Isn't it great???</p>

<br>

<h4>Fifth time onwards:</h4>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> But, Sif, I'm glad this is over!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> I can't wait to go back to my old job, you know? Make sure to say hi when you're near Jouvente, 'kay?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>ACT 3: Siffrin (fake2):</b></li>
    <li><b>ACT 4: Siffrin (fake3):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"What did you have to..."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> Doesn't matter.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Doesn't matter at all, it wasn't that important!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> Come on, go talk to everyone! I have... Some thinking to do.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> But, Sif, I'm glad this is over!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> I can't wait to go back to my old job, you know? Make sure to say hi when you're near Jouvente, 'kay?</p>

<p>(You nod.)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="third">Third: Odile interrupts</h2>

<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Are you both finished? Please wrap it up so we can go.</p>
<p><b>Odile (doubt1):</b> There's so much we have to do before we can go back to our lives. You two can talk later, okay?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (jhgsaghjsaghjas1):</b>  ...urgrhhshrhhjdshdsjhdsjhdshjkhjkdfargh.</p>
<p><b>Odile (what1):</b> Oh gems. Did I interrupt...?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (jhgsaghjsaghjas1):</b> It's fine. It's fine. It's all good.</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty2):</b> Are you sure? I'm...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (LMAO1):</b> No problem! Don't worry about it!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (awkward1):</b> There has to be a better moment later. A better moment than... Saving the country...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> ...urgh.</p>

<br>

<p>(. . .)</p>

<br>

<h4>If Siffrin didn't realize yet:</h4>
<p>(...Oh.)</p>

<br>

<p>Note: this is the exact moment Siffrin figures it out, if he hasn't already had this moment because of the shoulder touch.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Anyway, Sif, I'm glad this is over!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> I can't wait to go back to my old job, you know? Make sure to say hi when you're near Jouvente, 'kay?</p>

<br>

<p>(You nod.)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="fourth">Fourth: Isabeau interrupts</h2>

<p>Isabeau (surprised1): ...Uh, Sif? ...Is everything okay?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> "What?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm4):</b> You look... Kind of upset.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad4):</b> What's wrong?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> "Nothing! What did you want to tell me?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huh1):</b> No, it doesn't matter right now. You don't look good at all.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huh2):</b> Are you hungry, maybe? I can tell Bonnie to--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(STARS.)</i></p>
<p>(Oooooooooooooh, you want to scream. You just want to scream right now.)</p>
<p>(You did everything right. And he won't say it. He can't say it. The Universe won't let him say it!)</p>
<p>(You're not stupid. You know what it is! What he wants to tell you! You know!)</p>
<p>(But it doesn't count if he doesn't say it! It doesn't exist if it's not said!)</p>
<p>(In fact, you can't trust it even if he did say it! Maybe it's not even true! Maybe it is! Maybe it is and it's because you forced him to!)</p>
<p>(You did, didn't you? You forced him, you're forcing him right now!)</p>
<p>(Looping forwards and backwards, making sure no one can interrupt, making sure everything is perfect! Making sure you're perfect!)
<p>(It's because you're looping, you're forcing him, manipulating him to say it! To think it!)</p>
<p>(Making sure he has to say it! Making sure he has no recourse!)</p>
<p>(It's not good! It's awful! He can't feel this way about someone like you!)</p>
<p><i>(SOMEONE DISGUSTING LIKE YOU!!!!!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (huhwah1):</b> --frin, Siffrin! Please stop gripping your hair, you're going to hurt yourself--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (terrified1):</b> "DON'T TOUCH ME--"</p>

<br>

<p>(You feel a tug on your stomach--)</p>

<br>

<p>Time rewinds.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (surprised1):</b> --everything okay?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> "Yep, all good!"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Oh... Okay!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Anyway, Sif, I'm glad this is over!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> I can't wait to go back to my old job, you know? Make sure to say hi when you're near Jouvente, 'kay?</p>

<br>

<p>(You nod, smile fixed on your face.)</p>

<br>

<p>(You got a MEMORY OF CONFESSION!)</p>
<p>(You'll always remember this.)</p>

<br>

<p>[When equipped, Memory of Confession makes your Fighter immune to Rock attacks.]</p>

<br>

<h2 id="last">Last: Siffrin interrupts</h2>

<p>(There it is again.)</p>
<p>(You try to keep your face neutral.)</p>
<p>(Or will a neutral face make him stop--)</p>
<p>(Oh, wait, you remembered. It doesn't matter what you do.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (worried1):</b> I...!!!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "Will this be quick?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (surprised1):</b> I, um... What?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fake1):</b> "I should go talk with everyone else."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (awkward1):</b> Oh, um...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Yeah, sure, I... I understand.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (uwah!1):</b> It wasn't important anyway! Go talk to everyone!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> But, Sif, I'm glad this is over!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> I can't wait to go back to my old job, you know?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> They probably missed me.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Okay, go talk to everyone! Shoo!</p>

<br>

<p>(You nod.)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="act4">ACT 4 add on</h2>
<p>The regular conversation has this added to the end, whatever came before, if you're in ACT 4.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> ...Stupid stuff aside, though...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad1):</b> Are you doing okay?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (surprised1):</b> (Huh?)</li>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> I don't know, you've had a weird vibe since yesterday, so I just wanna make sure you're good now.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> Are you good?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> (. . .) "Yeah!"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> Okay, good!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> I mean, "Okay, good", as in "I don't believe you for a second but we'll have time to talk about it tonight", you know.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Come on, go and talk to everyone else!</p>
