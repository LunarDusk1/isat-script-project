<br>

<h2 id="event">Event</h2>
<p><b>Location:</b>Inside the House (varies).</p>
<p><i>when interacting with unique Change God statues inside the House five times. This is required to unlock the later Change God scene (Who was phone achievement).</i></p>

<br>
  
<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> Siffrin? Are you curious about the Change God's statues, perhaps...?</p>
  
<br>
  
<p><b>First time: Siffrin (awkward1):</b> (Oh, um...)</p>
<p><b>Subsequent times:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>ACT 2-3: Siffrin (questions1):</b> <i>(...)</i></li>
  <li><b>ACT 4: Siffrin (fake1):</b> <i>(...)</i></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="C1"><a href="#choice">Choice 1:</a> "I'm just wondering why they're broken."</h4>
 
<p><b>Odile (huh2):</b> That's the King's doing, isn't it?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> They're statues of the Change God, and the King wants to freeze Vaugarde in time, so... Maybe the King wanted to make a statement.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> "Look how useless your god is!!!" That sorta thing.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> But only the faces are destroyed... Normally, you'd destroy the whole statue, right?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> The face is important, Dile.</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm2):</b> Oh?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Yes! Um, so, every statue we've seen so far is made by a different Crafter, or artist!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> It's kind of a cultural thing to Craft your own Change God.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> The Change God is always changing, always different... And we all have our own version of the Change God in our brains!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b>  The Change God is always depicted wearing the same clothes, so they're at least recognizable in that way...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> But their face is always changing!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (yeah!2):</b> I think the Change God has like a thousand eyes!!! That's how they can see everything!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed2):</b> I've heard someone say the Change God had sewn their own mouth shut... Unable to tell us how to change, and leaving it to us poor humans to figure it out!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> I had a dream they had dimples!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> And, and! Since it's Crafted by us, it's supposed to represent our connection to the Change God!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> The Change God, by their very nature, doesn't interact with humans much...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (andthen1):</b> Except for when they blessed Mirabelle!</p>
<p><b> Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Ah... Y-Yes...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> B-But by Crafting the Change God's face, we get linked to them in some small way!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> And some people even get to communicate with the Change God through the statues they made, as well!</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh3):</b> Oh, really?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> Nah, not really.
<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> Yes, really!!! I've met someone who's talked to the Change God, when they finished their statue!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really3):</b> Was it in a dream, maybe? Because you know that doesn't count.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (serious1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> A-Anyway, that's why all the statues are different from one another!</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> Interesting... So it's a cultural tradition to make your own statue.</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> And it's a connection between you and the Change God...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> How do you connect with your gods, m'dame?</p>
<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> We make shrines for our gods, and everyone shares the shrines.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huhwah1):</b> SHARING GODS............</p>
  
<br>
  
<p><i>(Interesting.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Now that you know more about the statues and the Change belief, maybe you could check Mirabelle's statue once more...)</i></p>
<p><b>ACT 2 only:</b> <i>(Not right now, though. You have a King to beat.)</i></p>
  
<br>

<h4 id="C2"><a href="#choice">Choice 2:</a> "No, not really."</h4>
 
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious1):</b> Ah... Okay...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> W-Well, let me know if you ever want to know more about them, okay?!?</p>

<br>

<p><b>First time:</b></p>
<p><i> (Was it because you looked at the statues too often...?)</i></p>

<p><b>Subsequent times:</b></p>
<p><i> (You looked at the statues too often again.)</i></p>
