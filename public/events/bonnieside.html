<h3>First time</h3>

<p><i>(There's a space in between two books, like someone removed it.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (sad1):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...Ah, Bonnie seems to be reading it intently.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It has a very striking cover of a Mwudu clay figurine with large, sunken eyes and a screaming mouth.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You can't read the title...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (smiling3):</b> <i>(You're curious.)</i> "What do you have here?"</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> !!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Bonnie hides the book in their pocket.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> N-nothing!!! It's nothing!!! Nothing at all!!!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> <i>(Sure.)</i> "Okay..."</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> Shut up!!! It's fine!!! I'm fine!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry1):</b> ...S-stop looking at it, stop looking at me!!! Shut up!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> Here take this book instead!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Bonnie shoves a book at you.)</i></p>
<p><i>("Sneezing: How To Expulse Bad Thoughts".)</i></p>
<p><i>(Wow............)</i></p>

<h3>Subsequent times without progressing the quest:</h3>
<p><i>(There's a space in between two books, like someone removed it.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Bonnie took the book with the weird figurine on the cover with them, like they did the first time.)</i></p>
<p><i>(The cover with a Mwudu clay figurine with large, sunken eyes, and a screaming mouth...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You're curious. Can you find that book elsewhere?)</i></p>

<p>"Bonnie was looking at a book...."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> They were, weren't they?</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> A book with a scary figurine on it... They acted very defensive when they saw you'd noticed.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> But... Who cares? Is it that important to find out?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Something about it worries you.)</i></p>

<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> Maybe not. We might still have a lot to--</p>

<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> I don't get this swole by skipping meals!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> Urgh. Anyway, let's take a break for now...</p>

<br>

<p><i>The group sits down. Bonnie is off in the corner, preparing snacks.</i></p>

<p><b>Isabeau (awkward1):</b> So, um... We haven't brought it up yet, so um... I have a question?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (haha1):</b> Ah, a secret adult conversation for adults no kids allowed?</p>
<p><b>Odile (doubt1):</b> Do you not want Boniface to hear?</p>

<p><b>Isabeau (wonder1):</b> In case, Change forbid, one of us dies today, and the others are able to honor your body...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> How should we do it?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (awkward1):</b> ...Like, m'dame Odile, is there a Ka Buan way, or...</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b> ...No, it's... It's a valid concern.</p>
<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> Well... In Ka Bue, you'd burn the body and take the ashes to a Gemmaker to transform them into a diamond, but that won't be easily feasible, will it...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> You'd change into a diamond?!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (oh1):</b> Hardcore...</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> But if that's not doable, you can donate my body to any House in Vaugarde. If Vaugarde is saved, I'm sure they'd have a use for the body of a savior...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward2):</b> W-well, the House of Change recommends burying your body under a tree, so our body can nurture the nature around it.. Be part of Change and all that...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Is it the same for you, Isabeau?</p>

<br>

<p><i>Bonnie stops moving in the corner. They're listening.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> I mean, I'd be dead, right? So I don't really... care that much about later.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (awkward1):</b> And for, well, Bonnie, what should--</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (serious2):</b> We won't allow Bonnie to die.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b> Over our dead bodies.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> Even if we're about to die, there are ways to use Craft to make sure Bonnie will survive.</p>

<p><i>(You try to breathe deeply, in, and out.)</i></p>

<p><i>(You're not imagining it.)</i></p>

<p><b>Isabeau (sad2):</b> Oh, Bonnie...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad1):</b> Bonnie--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Oh no, why did you have to say anything.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Yeah, you had to say something, but they were listening all this time before and they were fine, right?!? Why did you have to say something?!)</i></p>

<p><b>Odile (worried2):</b> Please, listen to--</p>

<p><b>Bonnie (angry1):</b> You're all stupid for talking about this!!! Stupid, stupid, stupid!!!</p>

<p><i>(Touch!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You remember that touch is useful to make people less upset, or so you've heard.)</i></p>
<p><i>(No better time to try!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You approach Bonnie, and try to pat their head.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(You don't even get close before Bonnie slaps your hand away, and--)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (crying1):</b> Don't touch me!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry2):</b> Curse you, Frin!!! Don't come near me!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry2):</b> I don't want you to touch me, I don't want you to talk to me, I don't want you to even LOOK AT ME!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (crying2):</b> I don't want to think about ANY OF THIS!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You know this isn't about you. They need your help right now.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You try to approach them again--)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (crying1):</b> NO!!! STOP, STOP!!! DON'T COME NEAR ME!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry2):</b> I HATE YOU, FRIN!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (crying1):</b> If you like to talk about how everyone will die then you should just get it over with and die, Frin!!!!!! I don't care!!! I HATE YOU!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Your heart sinks.)</i></p>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide3):</b> <i>(...)</i> "Bury me somewhere. Can we talk about something else?"</p>
