<h1>Ghost</h1>
<p><b>Achievement:</b> (reloads dagger) house's haunted</p>>
<p><b>Memory:</b> Memory of Ghosts</p>
<p><b>Location:</b> Floor 3, last hallway before the snack break.</p>
<p><i>This page includes the special "Ghost" event. If all three ghosts are seen in the same loop, this event triggers before fighting the King. Only possible from ACT 3 onward.</i><p>
<p><i>As usual, all images are taken from and hosted on the ISATwiki.</i></p>


<br>

<p><i>The group enters the hallway and spot another Siffrin walking north.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (oh1):</b> Ah!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> Look! Here!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b>That's... That really looks like Siffrin, doesn't it?!</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> Another one, huh...?</p>
  
<br>

<p><i>("Another one"?!?)</i></p>
<p><i>(You've been seeing these... Ghosts, whatever they are, for a while, but...)</i></p>
<p><i>(They could see them too? This whole time?!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (surprised2):</b>"You can see them too?!"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> Yes??? Of course???</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> Yeah! Weird Frin copies!</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> This whole time I was thinking it was just my eyes... Or my mind, playing tricks on me... But..</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> Hm...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> Well, I'll go and say hi!</p>
 
<br>

<p><i>(!!!)</i></p>
 
<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (stop!2):</b> Me too... I wanna see the weird not-Frin!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(No, they can't!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You get chills just looking at it!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You don't know what they are, maybe they're dangerous--)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Me three! I'm curious!</p>
<p><b>Odile (isthatso1):</b> Me four. Of course.</p>

<br>

<p><i>Everbody except Siffrin walks toward the ghost, blocking its path to see its face. Only Siffrin is facing its back.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(You try to stop them, any of them, but...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You will not, cannot, go closer.)</i></p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Hey Sif, buddy!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Hello, other Siffrin!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Why are you here, weird Frin? Why do you disappear sometimes???</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> One question at a time, kids. We don't know if they can...

<p><i>(...The ghost you disappeared...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (no!1)</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huh2):</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (surprised 1):</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> That was weird.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (surprised2):</b> "What? What happened?"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (no!2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad3):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(What happened? Why aren't they looking at you?!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (awkward1):</b><i> (What did it do?!)</i> "Did it have boils on it… or something? Haha..."</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (no!2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (no!2):</b> N-no, they just...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad3):</b> Ah--!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Mirabelle started crying!!!)</i></p>
<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (surprised2):</b> "What's wrong!!!"</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> Belle!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (sad3):</b> S-Sorry! I-I don't know why I'm crying...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad2):</b> Hey, come on, it's okay...</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> Siffrin.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You jump.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (worried2):</b> You... You'd tell us if anything was wrong, right?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (what1):</b> "Of course!"</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (yelling2):</b> "So tell me what's wrong!!!"</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad3):</b> Hm...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Alright, I'll be on explaining duty!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Isabeau takes you aside.)</i></p>

<br>  

<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> It's fine, nothing bad happened.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> Like Bonbon said, it was just weird, is all.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (what1):</b><i> ("Weird"?)</i> "Did it do something?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm5):</b> Well, he, uh...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder1):</b> Okay, so that other Sif was standing there...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> And we got closer. And it was strange, 'cuz he wasn't looking at us when we came to them, right?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> He was looking straight ahead, not moving.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> But as I called out to him... I could see he kinda startled, like he was surprised.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad1):</b> And when we walked in front of them, they looked at us, and, they...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (surprised1):</b> "What?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad1):</b> Like...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad3):</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1)</b> See, usually I'd be happy to see that, but here it was just, uh...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (upset1):</b> "What? What???"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (worried1):</b> Let me speak, I'm trying to understand it too!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> First he looked surprised, and then...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> Then he looked at us like he was so happy to see us, he was going to cry.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad3):</b> Even more when they seemed to... Realize we were all here?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad3):</b> He looked at each of us, and their smile got bigger and bigger every time. Blissful.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad4):</b> But it wasn't... It wasn't nice or happy or anything. It was just...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad1):</b> Sad.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad3):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad2):</b> Why would you look at us like that...?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(That last sentence, said under his breath.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You're not sure you were meant to hear it.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> ...So that's why! It was just a little weird, that's all.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> And Mira's super stressed right now, so that's why she cried, you know? She'll be fine, we're all fine.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Yeah?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>Mirabelle and the others walk toward Isabeau and Siffrin.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Sorry for earlier... I feel better now!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> Are you okay too, Siffrin?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (hmf3):</b> I gave Belle some snacks so she's okay now.</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> Let's put this be… That slowed us down...</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan1):</b> Let's get going.</p>

<br>

<p><i>("Let's get going"?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>The screen shakes.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>("LET'S GET GOING"?!)</i></p>
<p><i>(Are they just going to put it behind them?!)</i></p>
<p><i>(That you all see visions of yourself in the House? Reflections?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Reflections that aren't you, that cry when they see them?)</i></p>
<p><i> (They're fine with it?)</i></p>
<p><i>(THEY'RE FINE WITH IT?!?)</i></p>
<p><i>(THEY DON'T CARE?!?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(THEY DON'T--)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>Time rewinds.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (oh1):</b> Ah!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2)</b> Look! Here!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> That's... That really looks like Siffrin, doesn't it?!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> "I don't see anything."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake4):</b> "There's nothing there."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huh1):</b> Huh? You don't see the--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake4):</b> "Nothing at all."</p>
  
<br>

<p><i>The ghost falls to its knees and disappears.</i></p>

<br>
  
<p><b>Bonnie (surprised1):</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Well, um... I feel like I saw something, but...</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b> Is the stress getting to us that badly?</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> Let's get going.</p>
