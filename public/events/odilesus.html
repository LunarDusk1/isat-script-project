<h2 id="notsus">Odile is suspicious but not all requirements met</h2>

<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b>But really, is everything okay?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b>What do you mean?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (doubt1):</b>I don't know, Siffrin. You've felt off since yesterday. More withdrawn, mostly.</p>

<p><b>Odile (serious2):</b>Tell me what's wrong.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b>Nothing's wrong!</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b>...It's okay if you don't want to tell me, you know.</p>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b>I'll find out eventually.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b>But I'm not hiding anything.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (serious2):</b>Siffrin.</p>

<p><b>Odile (serious1):</b>......</p>

<p><b>Odile (melan2):</b>...I'm missing something. I must be...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b>Well, nevermind, then.</p>

<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b>Just know I'm here if you want to talk.</p>

<p><b>Odile (lol3):</b>Well, not for much longer. So you better tell me soon.</p>

<h2 id="verysus">All requirements met, first time</h2>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b>But I'm not hiding anything.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (SusSpecial):</b>Is that so.</p>

<p><b>Odile (SusSpecial):</b>Is that so?</p>

<p><b>Odile (SusSpecial):</b>So Time Craft has nothing to do with you?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (awkward1):</b>(!)</p>

<p><b>Siffrin (awkward1):</b>No, that's--</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (serious1):</b>And the fact that you knew how to read that book about Wish Craft... Knew how to wish correctly, when no one else did...</p>

<p><b>Odile (serious2):</b>It doesn't mean anything, either?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake5):</b>(!!!)</p>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake5):</b>It's not like that, I--</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (serious2):</b>And the way you're acting, doing that stupid smile like nothing's wrong...</p>

<p><b>Odile (angry1):</b>It doesn't mean anything, either?!?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b>I'm not stupid, Siffrin.</p>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b>If I find something strange, I can do nothing except give it my full attention.</p>

<p><b>Odile (serious2):</b>And you are acting strange.</p>

<p><b>Odile (angry1):</b>There were so many signs... I did not understand them, but now I do!</p>

<p><b>Odile (angry1):</b>You've been acting strange since you woke up from your nap, yesterday!</p>

<p><b>Odile (serious3):</b>When we talk to you, you act out of it, almost bored...</p>

<p><b>Odile (serious3):</b>And the way you reacted to the rocks falling...</p>

<p><b>Odile (serious2):</b>We all jumped, but you just looked at them fall, calmly.</p>

<p><b>Odile (angry1):</b>And there's so many other things, the way you reacted to so many things throughout our entire journey through the House!</p>

<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b>And, and...</p>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b>And how every time you found the keys we needed to proceed, you didn't seem surprised, like you knew exactly where they were.</p>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b>Even that key hidden in the classroom.</p>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b>Almost like...</p>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b>....Like you had found them before, maybe?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(!!!!!!)</i></p>

<p><i>(No no no no no no--)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (no!!!1):</b>(Say something!!!)</p>

<p><b>Siffrin (no!!!1):</b>B-But that'd be impossible, though!</p>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake5):</b>How could I have known where the keys were when it's my first time here?!?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (angry2):</b>I don't know, Siffrin, why don't you enlighten me?!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (serious2):</b>Don't think I believed that whole "I wished croissants would disappear~" thing, too.</p>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b>So, if you lied about your wish...</p>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b>What did you wish for, then?</p>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b>That's it, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b>Did something happen? To you, to us? Did we die against the King, maybe?</p>

<p><b>Odile (serious2):</b>Is that why you're repeating the same events, Siffrin?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry4):</b>SHUT UP!!!</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (huh1):</b>!</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (oh!1):</b>!</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (surprised1):</b>!</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (no1):</b>Even if you figure it out, Odile...</p>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry4):</b>It's too late! It's too late! It's always too late!!!</p>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry4):</b>Did you have to figure it out now, when it's all about to end?</p>

<p><b>ThreateningSiffrin (angry1):</b>You can't help me, Odile!!! No one can!!!</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (huh2):</b>Sif, Odile...?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (wait1):</b>What's happening? Why are you yelling?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry4):</b>It's too late!!!</p>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry4):</b>YOU CAN'T HELP ME!!!</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (worried2):</b>But--</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (unhinged4):</b>And I think, weirdly, I don't even want you to help me?</p>

<p><b>ThreateningSiffrin (unhinged2):</b>Why don't I want you to help me?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (no!1):</b>Siffrin--</p>

<br>

<p><b>ThreateningSiffrin (unhinged1):</b>Maybe because I know that if you help me, you'll start hating me!!!</p>

<p><b>ThreateningSiffrin (unhinged1):</b>Because I don't know why this is all happening, but--</p>

<p><b>ThreateningSiffrin (unhinged1):</b>It must be because of me, that we're repeating the same events!!!</p>

<p><b>Siffrin (terrified1):</b>And if you knew that, you'd hate me</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (no!1):</b>Siffrin?!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Burnt sugar.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (terrified1):</b>And I don't want you to hate me</p>

<p><b>Siffrin (terrified1):</b>So, so, so--</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b>...!It's okay if you don't want to tell me, you know.</p>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b>I'll find out eventually.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b>Maybe, teehee!</p>
