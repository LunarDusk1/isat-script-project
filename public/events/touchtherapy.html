<h1 id="touch1">Touch 1 to 3</h1>

<h3>First time:</h3>

<p><i>(WOW there's no place to pass through with everyone following you.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You try your best to pass through the tight space between your [friends/allies/family members], the tables, and the wall.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Second time:</h3>
<p><i>(You try your best to pass through the tight space between your [friends/allies/family members], the tables, and the wall.)</i></p>
<p><i>(As you pass through, you realize, not for the first time in this situation, that everyone unconsciously makes sure to not touch you any more than necessary.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It's not the best feeling, but there must be a reason they're not touching you, so you leave it alone.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Third time:</h3>
<p><i>(While passing through, you stumble and accidentally bump against Odile.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You jump and yelp.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (huh1):</b> Woah!</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> Oh, sorry, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (awkward1):</b> "I, uh, I just wasn't--"</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Ha! Don't worry, you're good.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> We are used to your weird aversion to touch.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Your what?)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="loop1">Loop Chat 1</h1>

<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> My turn, actually, my turn! I have a question!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You guess that's fair...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> Of course it's fair.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> So, I've seen you don't like to be touched, huh? Why do you think that is?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (awkward1):</b> <i>(You flinch.)</i> "I'm just too precious to touch!"</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Haha!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> No, but really. Ever thought of NOT flinching when someone touches you, though?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(As if it was that easy. You just can't help it.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You can't help but jump when people touch you. You think it's because you're just not used to it.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It's not like you wanted to be like this...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> Maybe you could do some exposure therapy. Try to touch your allies. Like in that gardening room in the House!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> You have nothing but time, after all!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="touch2">Touch 4 to 8</h1>

<h3>Fourth time:</h3>
<p><i>(Once again, you can tell that people make sure to give you some space.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Steeling yourself, you take a deep breath, and brush against everyone softly.)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(What a rush!)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Fifth time:</h3>
<p><i>(While passing through, you take a deep breath, and--)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (huhwah1):</b> Wah!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (blush3):</b> D-Don't poke my sides, Sif!!! I'm ticklish!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Oh, that's wonderful information to have.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You feel lightheaded.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Sixth time:</h3>
<p><i>(While passing through, you take a deep breath, and--)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> !</p>

<br>

<p><i>(As you gently poke her, she pokes you back.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Your cheeks feel warm.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Seventh time:</h3>

<p><i>(While passing through, you take a deep breath, and--)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (what2):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You quickly poked Odile's side.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Beyond throwing you a look, she doesn't react.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You try not to smile.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Eighth time:</h3>
<p><i>(While passing through, you take a deep breath, and--)</i></p>
<p><i>(Poke.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> Poke my cheek again and die.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Yep, message received.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You giggle under your breath.)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="loop2">Loop Chat 2</h1>

<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> My turn, actually, my turn! I have a question!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> So, so, so, how's your touch exposure therapy going?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Your what?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (teehee2):</b> In the gardening room! You've been practicing to touch your party in that annoyingly cramped room, right?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (okay2):</b> <i>(How does Loop know about this...)</i> "It's going well."</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> I'm so happy for you!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Touching people is so weird, right? At least you have all the time in the world to get used to it!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee4):</b> Especially since they don't remember what you did if you loop, right? Removes all the yucky yucky ew vulnerability of it all.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(. . .)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="touch3">Touch 9 to 12</h1>

<h3>Ninth time:</h3>

<h4>ACT 2:</h4>
<p><i>(While passing through, you discreetly touch everyone.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You're getting better at this!)</i></p>

<h4>ACT 3 & 4:</h4>
<p><i>(As you pass through the tight space between the tables and the wall, you brush against everyone.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Touch touch touch touch.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You try to get some human contact every loop, even if it's discreetly like this.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Tenth time:</h3>
<p><i>(You brush against everyone again.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You've read somewhere that humans need a certain amount of skin-to-skin contact otherwise they go insane.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Asking for skin-to-skin contact would be weird, so you content yourself with clothes-to-clothes.)</i></p>
<p><i>(What do books know, anyway?)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Eleventh time:</h3>
<p><i>(Poke poke poke poke.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Poke!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(!)</i></p>
<p><i>(Without meaning to, you smile.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (sif!1):</b> !!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (awkward1):</b> Kids, please...</p>

<br>

<h3>Twelfth time onwards:</h3>

<p><i>(You poke everyone again, but this time no one reacts.)</i></p>
<p><i>(. . .)</i>

<br>

<p><i>(Someone, anyone...)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="loop3">Loop Chat 3</h1>

<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> My turn, actually, my turn! I have a question!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...So-</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> How's your touch therapy going?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You know, poking all your party members in the gardening room.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide3):</b> <i>(...)</i> "Does it matter?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (well3):</b> That well, huh?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(They used to react before, when you touched them.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Why aren't they reacting now?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Poke, poke, poke, poke.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You keep trying and trying, but nothing changes.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It's like you aren't even here anymore.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It's like you're being erased.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Are you here?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Are you even living?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Someone, anyone... Please...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> I see you, stardust.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> I see you.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> Y-You're still here, look!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(With some hesitation, Loop brings their hand forwards...)</i></p>
<p><i>(...and pokes your gloved hand.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You feel pressure, and warmth.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Stardust.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> You're here, with me.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You breathe out.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Loop seems to flash you a hesitant smile.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You smile back.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (sadsmile2):</b> "You're also here, with me."</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh1):</b> ...!</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...Ha...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> I sure am!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<h1 id="touch4">Touch 13+</h1>

<p><i>(You poke everyone again, but this time no one reacts.)</i></p>
<p><i>(. . .)</i>

<br>

<p><i>(You're here.)</i></p>
