<h1>Confession & Bad Touch</h1>
<p>WIP note: reformat to new standard.</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> Map020 (LastRoom)</p>
<p>Both events involving the romantic subplot, put together for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<br>

<p>Siffrin can realize Isabeau's feelings at two different points. First, when <a href="#third">Odile interrupts</a> Isabeau's confession. Second, during the <a href="#touch1">fourth Shoulder Touch</a> after asking him about the hand thing. This triggers monologue changes related to Isabeau, most notably in his <a href="/acts/act3-4/isaquest.html">Friendquest</a>.</p>

<h1 id="confession">Confession</h1>
<p>Isabeau's many, many attempts to confess at the very end of it all.</p>
<p>For all the insane variables behind this, check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CAMqkcEUkpJBD3nno6GCwQ2BhDej4Y1Nvj4dsZKLPr0/edit?usp=drive_link">this nifty spreadsheet</a>. Also the <a href="https://instarsandtime.wiki.gg/wiki/Confession_Event">wiki page</a> on it based on said spreadsheet.</p>
<p>This is all only available in a loop without all Friendquests completed.</p>

<p><b>Bonnie (stop!1):</b> ARE YOU GUYS DONE TALKING ALREADY?????? CRAB!!!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (and then1):</b> I wanna go so I can eat dinner!!! I'm super duper hungry!!!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (jhgsaghjsaghjas1):</b> jkghsdafhjhkdsfhjkadfshjkadfsjhkdsfjkhdsf</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> So are you done? Are you done talking?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (jhgsaghjsaghjas1):</b> ...............................yeah we're done talking.</p>

<br>

<h4>First time only:</h4>
<p>(...?)</p>
<p>(He didn't get to tell you what he wanted... That's too bad.)</p>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> But, Sif, I'm glad this is over!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> I can't wait to go back to my old job, you know? Make sure to say hi when you're near Jouvente, 'kay?</p>

<br>

<p>(You nod.)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="loop1">Intermission: Loop makes fun of Siffrin</h2>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "At the end, Isabeau..."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Ah, the thing he said he'd tell you at the end of your journey?
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> He mentions he wants to tell you something, when you go and sleep at the Clocktower... That's probably it.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> But someone interrupted him just as he was about to tell you! How unfortunate!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> If only there was a way to make sure he wouldn't be interrupted, maybe you'd finally get to hear what he has to say...</p>


<br>

<h4>Before distracting Bonnie for the first time:</h4>
<p>(If you talked to Bonnie beforehand, maybe...)</p>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h4>After multiple interruptions:</h4>
<p>(And it keeps happening, too.)</p>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h3>Telling Bonnie to shut up</h3>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> (...Before you forget, though...) "Do you have some snacks left?"</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> Oh, um... Well...</p>

<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>ACT 3:</b> (Bonnie looks through their pockets.)</li>
    <li><b>ACT 4:</b> (They just looked through their pockets, but they check again.)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>ACT 3: Bonnie (serious1):</b> I won't give them to you, I'm super hungry.</li>
    <li><b>ACT 4: Bonnie (serious1):</b> I know you're hungry too, but I'll keep those for myself, sorry.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (hmf2):</b> That way I'll survive until I eat dinner!!! See, aren't I so smart?</p>

<br>

<p>(Very smart. But you're smarter.)</p>
<p>(You should make sure to talk to everyone you need to before talking to Isabeau...)</p>

<br>

<h3>Mirabelle's interruption</h3>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> EVERYONE!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy4):</b> I'm so glad we managed to win!!! Can you believe it?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> I think this calls for a group hug!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (and then1):</b> GROUP HUG!!!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b> Pass.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> Doesn't matter.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Doesn't matter at all, it wasn't that important!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> Come on, go talk to everyone! I have... Some thinking to do.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> But, Sif, I'm glad this is over!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> I can't wait to go back to my old job, you know? Make sure to say hi when you're near Jouvente, 'kay?</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> Oh, would you be okay with it??? I'd love to!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(You nod.)</p>
<p>(You should make sure to talk to everyone before talking to Isabeau...)</p>

<br>

<h3>Odile's interruption</h3>

<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Are you both finished? Please wrap it up so we can go.</p>
<p><b>Odile (doubt1):</b> There's so much we have to do before we can go back to our lives. You two can talk later, okay?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (jhgsaghjsaghjas1):</b>  ...urgrhhshrhhjdshdsjhdsjhdshjkhjkdfargh.</p>
<p><b>Odile (what1):</b> Oh gems. Did I interrupt...?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (jhgsaghjsaghjas1):</b> It's fine. It's fine. It's all good.</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty2):</b> Are you sure? I'm...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (LMAO1):</b> No problem! Don't worry about it!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (awkward1):</b> There has to be a better moment later. A better moment than... Saving the country...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> ...urgh.</p>

<br>

<p>(. . .)</p>

<br>

<h4>If Siffrin didn't realize yet:</h4>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Anyway, Sif, I'm glad this is over!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> I can't wait to go back to my old job, you know? Make sure to say hi when you're near Jouvente, 'kay?</p>

<h2 id="fourth">Fourth: Isabeau interrupts</h2>

<h3>Telling Odile to shut up</h3>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> (...Before you forget, though...) "Please don't interrupt."</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> Don't interrupt? Interrupt what...</p>

<br>

<p>(She looks Isabeau's way.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (isthatso1):</b> ...Of course.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> I have to say I'm surprised, Siffrin. I thought you didn't know--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> "I'm going now."</p>
<p><b>Odile (doubt1):</b> Hm.</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading2):</b> ...Good luck, I suppose.</p>

<br>

<h3>The actual thing</h3>

<p>Isabeau (surprised1): ...Uh, Sif? ...Is everything okay?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> "What?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm4):</b> You look... Kind of upset.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad4):</b> What's wrong?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> "Nothing! What did you want to tell me?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huh1):</b> No, it doesn't matter right now. You don't look good at all.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huh2):</b> Are you hungry, maybe? I can tell Bonnie to--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(STARS.)</i></p>
<p>(Oooooooooooooh, you want to scream. You just want to scream right now.)</p>
<p>(You did everything right. And he won't say it. He can't say it. The Universe won't let him say it!)</p>
<p>(You're not stupid. You know what it is! What he wants to tell you! You know!)</p>
<p>(But it doesn't count if he doesn't say it! It doesn't exist if it's not said!)</p>
<p>(In fact, you can't trust it even if he did say it! Maybe it's not even true! Maybe it is! Maybe it is and it's because you forced him to!)</p>
<p>(You did, didn't you? You forced him, you're forcing him right now!)</p>
<p>(Looping forwards and backwards, making sure no one can interrupt, making sure everything is perfect! Making sure you're perfect!)
<p>(It's because you're looping, you're forcing him, manipulating him to say it! To think it!)</p>
<p>(Making sure he has to say it! Making sure he has no recourse!)</p>
<p>(It's not good! It's awful! He can't feel this way about someone like you!)</p>
<p><i>(SOMEONE DISGUSTING LIKE YOU!!!!!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (huhwah1):</b> --frin, Siffrin! Please stop gripping your hair, you're going to hurt yourself--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (terrified1):</b> "DON'T TOUCH ME--"</p>

<br>

<p>(You feel a tug on your stomach--)</p>

<br>

<p>Time rewinds.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (surprised1):</b> --everything okay?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> "Yep, all good!"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Oh... Okay!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Anyway, Sif, I'm glad this is over!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> I can't wait to go back to my old job, you know? Make sure to say hi when you're near Jouvente, 'kay?</p>

<br>

<p>(You nod, smile fixed on your face.)</p>

<br>

<p>(You got a MEMORY OF CONFESSION!)</p>
<p>(You'll always remember this.)</p>

<br>

<p>[When equipped, Memory of Confession makes your Fighter immune to Rock attacks.]</p>

<br>

<h2 id="loop2">Intermission: Loop makes fun of Siffrin, again</h2>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "At the end, Isabeau..."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> ...Pft... Yeah...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> HAHAHAHAHA!!! Yeah!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> Your Fighter... He was about to tell you, without being interrupted, and you had to ruin it yourself!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> How nice of him, to stop himself from saying it because you looked upset!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> But you just really wanted him to tell you!!! Even though you know!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> Because you know what he wants to tell you, don't you? You can be dense sometimes, but you're not THAT dense!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> ...Teehee, ooooh, you're so angry! I can see it in your face!</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> Who are you angry at? At me??? But I'm just telling the truth, stardust~!</p>

<br>

<p>(And laughing about it.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Because it's just too funny, stardust!!! A blinding tragedy, and there's nothing you can do to change it!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> Hahahahahahahaha!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(You want to stop talking about this.)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="last">Last: Siffrin interrupts</h2>

<p>(There it is again.)</p>
<p>(You try to keep your face neutral.)</p>
<p>(Or will a neutral face make him stop--)</p>
<p>(Oh, wait, you remembered. It doesn't matter what you do.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (worried1):</b> I...!!!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "Will this be quick?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (surprised1):</b> I, um... What?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "I should go talk with everyone else."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (awkward1):</b> Oh, um...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Yeah, sure, I... I understand.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (uwah!1):</b> It wasn't important anyway! Go talk to everyone!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> But, Sif, I'm glad this is over!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> I can't wait to go back to my old job, you know?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> They probably missed me.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Okay, go talk to everyone! Shoo!</p>

<br>

<p>(You nod.)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="act4">ACT 4 add on</h2>
<p>The regular conversation has this added to the end, whatever came before, if you're in ACT 4.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> ...Stupid stuff aside, though...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad1):</b> Are you doing okay?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time: Siffrin (surprised1):</b> (Huh?)</li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b> (...)</li>
</ul>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> I don't know, you've had a weird vibe since yesterday, so I just wanna make sure you're good now.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (neutral1):</b> Are you good?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> (. . .) "Yeah!"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> Okay, good!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> I mean, "Okay, good", as in "I don't believe you for a second but we'll have time to talk about it tonight", you know.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Come on, go and talk to everyone else!</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h1 id="touch">The Shoulder Touch</h1>

<h2>Conversation start</h2>
<p>For simplicity's sake, this is the ACT 3 version. For all variations on the conversation, see <a href="/rooms/dormont/isatalk.html">Isabeau Beginning Talk</a>.</p>

<br>

<p>(Isabeau is here, probably pondering what favor to ask the Tree.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "Isa."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> Sif. Woke up on the wrong side of the bed? I get it.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (up1):</b> Anyway, I was just looking at the Favor Tree! Isn't this tree cool???</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> (Cue joke.) "Yeah it is..."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b>Glad you agree!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "One could say it's a pretty..."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sif!1):</b> Uh huh???</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "...TREE-mendous tree."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (LMAO1):</b> HAHAHA!!!!! YEAH!!!! YEAH!!!!!! YES!!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(You both laugh.)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="touch1">Before asking</h2>

<p>(Laughing uproariously, he raises his hand towards your shoulder...)</p>
<p>(...but stops, and brings it to his side.)</p>

<br>

<h4>Second time:</h4>
<p>(Didn't he do this before? What a weird gesture.)</p>

<br>

<h4>Third time:</h4>
<p>(What's up with the hand???)</p>

<br>

<h4>Fourth time:</h4>
<p>(Okay he did the hand thing again. You're too curious. You'll have to ask later.)</p>

<br>

<h4>Subsequent times before asking:</h4>
<p>(You need to ask!!!)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (sniff1):</b> Haa... That was funny.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="what">"What's up with the hand thing?"</h2>

<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> The... hand thing? What?</p>

<br>

<p>(You do the same gesture he does every time you talk to him at this time.)</p>
<p>(Bringing your hand up towards his shoulder, then sharply taking your hand back.)</p>
<p>(Isabeau looks at your gesture, confused, then suddenly stills.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (omgggg1):</b> Ah. Um. Well.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (shy1):</b> I'm. I was. Trying to touch your shoulder. As like. A bro thing.</p>

<br>

<p>(Huh?)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (omgggg1):</b> B-But I remembered you don't like to be touched!!! I remembered mid-move!!!! So I didn't touch you!!!! So it's okay!!! Sorry!!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(He was trying to touch your shoulder?)</p>
<p>(You're not sure how to react to this.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (shy1):</b> Aaaah, see, this is why I didn't do it! Because you do that face every time people try to touch you! I'm sorry!!! I try to remember!!!! Sorry!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>
<p>(Okay, you're confused, but...)</p>
<p>(It feels like he thinks you don't want to be touched.)</p>
<p>(You&nbsp; don't want to think about this anymore.)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="touch2">After asking</h2>

<h4>First time:</h4>
<p>(Laughing uproariously, he raises his hand towards your shoulder...)</p>
<p>(You get it now.)</p>
<p>(This is him&nbsp; trying to touch you.)</p>
<p>(You freeze.)</p>
<p>(His hand is in the air.)</p>
<p>(And goes closer... Closer...)</p>
<p>(His hand&nbsp; abruptly stops above your shoulder, and goes back to his side.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (sniff1):</b> Haa... That was funny.</p>

<br>

<h4>Second time:</h4>

<p>(Laughing uproariously, he raises his hand towards your shoulder...)</p>
<p>(You watch his hand get closer to you again.)</p>
<p>(Maybe this time...)</p>
<p>(Closer... Closer...)</p>
<p>(His hand&nbsp; abruptly stops above your shoulder, and goes back to his side.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (sniff1):</b> Haa... That was funny.</p>

<br>

<h4>Third time:</h4>
<p>(You wait for him to touch you.)</p>
<p>(You're beginning to think he never will.)</p>
<p>(You look at his hand coming closer... Closer...)</p>
<p>(As expected, his hand stops above your shoulder.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (sniff1):</b> Haa... That was funny.</p>

<br>

<h4>Fourth time:</h4>
<p>Only possible starting in ACT 3.</p>

<br>

<p>(You wait for him to touch you. You wait for him to touch you. You wait for him to touch you.)</p>
<p>(He has to do it. You will never do it yourself.)</p>
<p>(But he won't touch you because he thinks you don't want him to.)</p>
<p>(And you can't say it. Because. That's embarrassing.)</p>
<p>(That's life-ending, even. Asking for someone's touch.)</p>
<p>(But please, you think. Please, please, please.)</p>
<p>(A flicker of movement makes you look at his face.)</p>

<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide3):</b> "..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> Stardust, you traitor!!! I thought what we had was special!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide3):</b> "..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> But you didn't value me, did you, and I had to see you kiss the fighter, in front of my very eyes! The shock! The betrayal!!!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide3):</b> "Shut up."</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> And then you looped right back! Refusing to face the consequences of your actions!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> What were you afraid of? For him to finally see you? To see what kind of person you truly are?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Maybe he would have accepted you, you know. Maybe you're not as disgusting as you think you are.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (no1):</b> "Shut up!"</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> Or, stardust... Maybe you ARE that disgusting. Not letting the poor fighter make his own decisions! Who would do that! Or--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry4):</b> "SHUT. UP."</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry4):</b> "I don't want to talk or THINK about ANY of this."</p>

<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> But, stardust... Who else but me?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (scary3):</b> "..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> Anyway, you got a Memory for your troubles. You can check it out later, I don't think you'd like me to tell you what it does.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> So! How can I help you on this wonderful new loop?</p>
