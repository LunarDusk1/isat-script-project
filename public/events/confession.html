<h1>Confession & Bad Touch</h1>
<p>WIP note: reformat to new standard.</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> Map020 (LastRoom)</p>
<p><i>Both events involving the romantic subplot, put together for your viewing pleasure.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>Siffrin can realize Isabeau's feelings at two different points. First, when <a href="#third">Odile interrupts</a> Isabeau's confession. Second, during the <a href="#touch1">fourth Shoulder Touch</a> after asking him about the hand thing. This triggers monologue changes related to Isabeau, most notably in his <a href="/acts/act3-4/isaquest.html">Friendquest</a>.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Ah, the thing he said he'd tell you at the end of your journey?
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> He mentions he wants to tell you something, when you go and sleep at the Clocktower... That's probably it.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> But someone interrupted him just as he was about to tell you! How unfortunate!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> If only there was a way to make sure he wouldn't be interrupted, maybe you'd finally get to hear what he has to say...</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>ACT 3: Bonnie (serious1):</b> I won't give them to you, I'm super hungry.</li>
    <li><b>ACT 4: Bonnie (serious1):</b> I know you're hungry too, but I'll keep those for myself, sorry.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (hmf2):</b> That way I'll survive until I eat dinner!!! See, aren't I so smart?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Very smart. But you're smarter.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You should make sure to talk to everyone you need to before talking to Isabeau...)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Mirabelle's interruption</h3>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> EVERYONE!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy4):</b> I'm so glad we managed to win!!! Can you believe it?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> I think this calls for a group hug!!!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> Oh, would you be okay with it??? I'd love to!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You nod.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You should make sure to talk to everyone before talking to Isabeau...)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>Odile's interruption</h3>

<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Are you both finished? Please wrap it up so we can go.</p>
<p><b>Odile (doubt1):</b> There's so much we have to do before we can go back to our lives. You two can talk later, okay?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (jhgsaghjsaghjas1):</b>  ...urgrhhshrhhjdshdsjhdsjhdshjkhjkdfargh.</p>
<p><b>Odile (what1):</b> Oh gems. Did I interrupt...?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (jhgsaghjsaghjas1):</b> It's fine. It's fine. It's all good.</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty2):</b> Are you sure? I'm...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(She looks Isabeau's way.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (isthatso1):</b> ...Of course.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> I have to say I'm surprised, Siffrin. I thought you didn't know--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> "I'm going now."</p>
<p><b>Odile (doubt1):</b> Hm.</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading2):</b> ...Good luck, I suppose.</p>

<br>

<h3>The actual thing</h3>

<p><i>Isabeau (surprised1):</i> ...Uh, Sif? ...Is everything okay?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> "What?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm4):</b> You look... Kind of upset.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad4):</b> What's wrong?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake3):</b> "Nothing! What did you want to tell me?"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huh1):</b> No, it doesn't matter right now. You don't look good at all.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huh2):</b> Are you hungry, maybe? I can tell Bonnie to--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(STARS.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Oooooooooooooh, you want to scream. You just want to scream right now.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You did everything right. And he won't say it. He can't say it. The Universe won't let him say it!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You're not stupid. You know what it is! What he wants to tell you! You know!)</i></p>
<p><i>(But it doesn't count if he doesn't say it! It doesn't exist if it's not said!)</i></p>
<p><i>(In fact, you can't trust it even if he did say it! Maybe it's not even true! Maybe it is! Maybe it is and it's because you forced him to!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You did, didn't you? You forced him, you're forcing him right now!)</i></p>
<p><i>(Looping forwards and backwards, making sure no one can interrupt, making sure everything is perfect! Making sure you're perfect!)</i>
<p><i>(It's because you're looping, you're forcing him, manipulating him to say it! To think it!)</i></p>
<p><i>(Making sure he has to say it! Making sure he has no recourse!)</i></p>
<p><i>(It's not good! It's awful! He can't feel this way about someone like you!)</i></p>
<p><i>(SOMEONE DISGUSTING LIKE YOU!!!!!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (huhwah1):</b> --frin, Siffrin! Please stop gripping your hair, you're going to hurt yourself--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (terrified1):</b> "DON'T TOUCH ME--"</p>

<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> How nice of him, to stop himself from saying it because you looked upset!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> But you just really wanted him to tell you!!! Even though you know!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> Because you know what he wants to tell you, don't you? You can be dense sometimes, but you're not THAT dense!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> ...Teehee, ooooh, you're so angry! I can see it in your face!</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> Who are you angry at? At me??? But I'm just telling the truth, stardust~!</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "Isa."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> Sif. Woke up on the wrong side of the bed? I get it.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (up1):</b> Anyway, I was just looking at the Favor Tree! Isn't this tree cool???</p>

<p><i>(And you can't say it. Because. That's embarrassing.)</i></p>
<p><i>(That's life-ending, even. Asking for someone's touch.)</i></p>
<p><i>(But please, you think. Please, please, please.)</i></p>
<p><i>(A flicker of movement makes you look at his face.)</i></p>
<p><i>(He looks&nbsp; stricken. Sad.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Seeing you look at him, he laughs&nbsp; and brings his hand down.)</i></p>

<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> But you didn't value me, did you, and I had to see you kiss the fighter, in front of my very eyes! The shock! The betrayal!!!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide3):</b> "Shut up."</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b> And then you looped right back! Refusing to face the consequences of your actions!</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> What were you afraid of? For him to finally see you? To see what kind of person you truly are?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Maybe he would have accepted you, you know. Maybe you're not as disgusting as you think you are.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (no1):</b> "Shut up!"</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b> Or, stardust... Maybe you ARE that disgusting. Not letting the poor fighter make his own decisions! Who would do that! Or--</p>
