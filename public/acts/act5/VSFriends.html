<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Huh?!?</p>
<p><b>Odile (no!1):</b>What's happening?! Siffrin!!!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (sorry2):</b> What...</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (CRAB1):</b> AH--! NO!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (no!1):</b> No, no, no, stop!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry1):</b> NO!!! No attacking Frin-- He's our friend!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (crying1):</b> WE DON'T ATTACK FRIENDS!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (no!1):</b> BUT--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(hurts hurts hurts)</i></p>
<p><i>(we don't attack friends)</i></p>
<p><i>(so if odile is attacking you, it means you were never friends)</i></p>
<p><i>(it means you're hated hated hated)</i></p>

<h1 id="turn1">Turn 1</h1>

<p><b>Mirabelle (no!1):</b> Siffrin, stop!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> Frin, why are you doing this?!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (shock1):</b> What's happening, Sif?! Talk to us!!!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> Siffrin, what do you mean?!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> I-Isn't that what we all wanted?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (worried2):</b> I-It's what we should do next, right?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (worried1):</b> We beat the King! We save Vaugarde! We all go home!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> Y-Yeah!!! Now that the King is gone, everything will go back to how it was before, right?!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sad1):</b> Belle stays here, Dile goes back to Ka Bue, Za to Jouvente, and--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(YOU CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO GO HOME!!!!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(BECAUSE... BECAUSE IF THEY DO, THEN...!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<h1 id="turn3">Turn 3</h1>

<p><b>Odile (no!1):</b> Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Odile (no!1):</b> I don't understand! Don't you want to go back? Back to where you're from?</p>
<p><b>Odile (angry3):</b> Why else come with Mirabelle, if you didn't want to beat the King just so you could go back home?!?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "I CAN'T GO BACK! AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO!"</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> Can't go back...?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "I HAVE NOWHERE TO GO BACK TO, AND YOU ALL DO! I WON'T LET YOU!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "I WON'T LET YOU GO!!!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "WE CAN STAY HERE, CAN'T WE? WE CAN BE HAPPY!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "THE KING IS BEATEN! THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE WISHED FOR!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "AND IT'S THE END! THE KING IS GONE, AND YOU'RE WITH ME!"</p>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "AFTER ALL THIS TIME, I HAVE IT! A PERFECT ENDING! BECAUSE WE'VE WON, AND YOU'RE HERE!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "I WON'T LET YOU GO HOME, NOT NOW! I'VE GONE THROUGH IT ALL TOO MANY TIMES!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "I WON'T GO BACK, AND I WON'T LET YOU GO, NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE! NOW THAT WE CAN BE HAPPY!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "EVERYONE GOING THEIR SEPARATE WAYS... EVERYONE GOING HOME..."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "THIS IS NOT WHAT I WISHED FOR!!!!!!"</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (wait1):</b> What...?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> "A perfect ending"...?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> "Not what I wished for"...</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> "Gone... Through it all... Too many times."</p>
<p><b>Odile (fight1):</b> Loop was correct, then.</p>

<br>

<h1 id="turn5">Turn 5</h1>

<p><b>Odile (fight1):</b> Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> The way you acted yesterday... The things you said...</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b> Maybe you DID mean them. Maybe you didn't. Maybe it's a little bit of both.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> But beyond that... Some of the things you knew...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm1):</b> How you knew what Mira's papers were about...</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> How you knew about Isabeau's dream to design clothes...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> How you fell in battle, like you knew it would push Bonnie to defeat that Sadness...</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b> How you knew I was looking for a familytale, something I hadn't told anyone, and immediately knew where to find it, as well...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad4):</b> How you managed to go through the entire House on your own...</p>
<p><b>Odile (fight1):</b> Even the way you were acting when we fought the King...</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b> And, just now, how you've said you've "gone through it all, too many times"...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> Huh?!?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> You two... You don't mean...?</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b>  ...Looks like that star was right, hm?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Hahaha... I thought they were exaggerating, but...</p>
<p><i>Isabeau (disappointed2):</i> Siffrin, you...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm5):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad4):</b> You've been looping in time, haven't you?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...!!!!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(NO!!!!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(IF THEY FIND OUT YOU WISHED FOR THIS, THEY'LL HATE YOU!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(YOU HAVE TO LOOP BACK, YOU HAVE TO--)</i></p>
<p><i>(YOU FEEL A TUG ON YOUR STOMACH.)</i></p>

<img src="https://instarsandtime.wiki.gg/images/f/f3/ISAT_Event_ACT5_Odile_Stop.png" alt="Odile casting a Craft spell. One hand is outstretched, the other clutching her book. Odile is sweating, and looks determined.">

<p><b>Odile:</b> Oh no you don't.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> You won't be going any farther, young one.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> You are staying right here until we're done talking!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(no, no, she can't--)</i></p>
<p><i>(YOU CAN'T LET HER DO THIS!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (wait1):</b> Woaaaaah... That felt weird.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> That feeling... That was Time Craft, wasn't it?!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> Siffrin tried to rewind time just now, didn't they?!?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (stop!1):</b> Felt bad!!! It made the whole air smell like caramel someone left to burn for hours!!! Yuck!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad2):</b> Yuck indeed... I'm getting a headache just standing here.</p>
<p><b>Odile (angry3):</b> Siffrin!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (angry1):</b> I don't know how or why those loops are happening to you, but I won't let you escape.</p>
<p><b>Odile (angry3):</b> You are STAYING WITH US until we're DONE TALKING!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (stop!2):</b> Yeah!!! Dile's gonna make you stay right here, stupid!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (yeah!1):</b> Go m'dame Odile, go m'dame Odile, go!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(no no no no no no)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>On the party's next turn, their action text reads</i> "Your friends look determined."</p>

<br>

<h1 id="turn6">Turn 6</h1>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> But, looping in time, using Time Craft...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> L-Loop mentioned it before, and how you'd need a lot of power for that, right?!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (stop!2):</b> Oh, oh, that was the Wish Craft thing, yeah?!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> Wish Craft is stuff like going to the Favor Tree and asking for stuff to come true!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> Loop said you were both looking into what everyone wished, and that you thought it was because of everyone's wish to save Vaugarde...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> But if you thought everyone's wish was to blame...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad4):</b> Why would the wish's powers be centered on you?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> And, just now, Siffrin mentioned... Something about a wish they made... So...!</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b> You must know this already.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> The reason you're the only one who got those powers, when we were also on a journey to fight the King...</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Isn't it because you, somehow, got involved?</p>
<p><b>Odile (serious2):</b> Isn't it because of something YOU wished for?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(no, no, no, no, no, no...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (serious2):</b> Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (serious2):</b> I think you need to tell us your wish.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> Tell us your wish!!! It might be the key to freeing you!!! The key to making sure you won't loop anymore!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(no!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (worried1):</b> Tell us, so we can help you!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(NO!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (worried2):</b> Sif...</p>
<p><b>Odile (angry2):</b> Siffrin!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> SIFFRIN!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (angry2):</b> This is what I wished for!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1): I wished for Vaugarde to be saved!!!</b></p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!1): I wished for my sister to be okay!!!</b></p>
<p><b>Odile (angry3): I wished to win a stupid coin flip!!!</b></p>
<p><b>Isabeau (worried1): And I wished that we'd be able to find you, to help you, to save you, Sif!!!</b></p>
<p><b>Isabeau (worred2):</b> And what about you, Sif?!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (serious4):</b> What did you wish for?</p>
<p><b>Odile (angry2):</b> What did you wish for!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry1):</b> What did you wish for, Siffrin!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(STOP!!!!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(It doesn't matter!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(It won't come true, you know this now, you've accepted it, you did, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(they can't make you tell them, please, please, please--)</i></p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> What are you scared of?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "I'm scared that..."</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Hm...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Okay, but...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> But we REALLY wanna know, Frin.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Maybe we can kick your butt again to make you say it?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Yeah! If we do, you'll say it eventually, right?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> We should try it out.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Everyone, violence is NOT the answer!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> But I am in the mood for more butt kicking if you don't spit it out right now, yes.</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Oh? OH!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Oh... Siffrin... That's really lovely!!! Thank you!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> That is a very cute wish, Siffrin.</p>

<br>

<h4>Isabeau:</h4>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> R-Really? You'd... You'd like that?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I would love that, Sif!!! I would love to make clothes for you!!!</p>

<h4>Odile:</h4>

<h4>Mirabelle:</h4>
<p><i>(Mirabelle has changed so much since you've met her...)</i></p>

<h4>Isabeau:</h4>
<p><i>(You didn't expect to have so much fun traveling with Isabeau.)</i></p>

<h4>Odile:</h4>
<p><i>(Ka Bue is where Odile is from... She probably knows all the cool places.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Even if she doesn't, talking with Odile is always interesting. You're both strangers to this country, ignorant of its culture, so you have a lot in common.)</i></p>

<h4>Bonnie:</h4>
<p><i>(Bonnie has been distant from you lately...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You're not sure why.)</i></p>
<p><i>(But you'd like to be here when they see their sister again...)</i></p>

<h4>Always</h4>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "Deep down, I wished..."</p>

<br>

<h4>Mirabelle:</h4>
<p><i>(She doesn't realize it, but now she's able to talk to people while looking them in the eyes. Sometimes she even snarks back when you tease her, which you didn't think was even possible.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You'd <b>like to continue traveling with her and see her get even more comfortable expressing herself.</b>)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Isabeau:</h4>
<p><i>(You often joke together, but you never really talk about real, important things... You're glad he told you about his dream to become a clothes designer. It suits him.)</i></p>
<p><i>(To <b>talk to him, and watch him as he crafts clothes for you to wear... Seeing his smile as you wear something he created himself... It would make you happy.</b>)</i></p>

<h4>Odile:</h4>
<p><i>(Being with Odile is easy. Sometimes you feel like she understands you better than you understand yourself.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You'd <b>like to talk with her more so you can understand her, too.</b>)</i></p>

<h4>Bonnie:</h4>
<p><i>(They miss their sister so much. Sometimes you can hear them cry out at night, calling their sister's name.)</i></p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> I don't want to forget the times we all had together.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> And I wouldn't want to never talk to any of you again, either!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> A-And nothing is keeping me in Dormont! I would love to leave, to keep traveling! I've been thinking that for a while!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> But... But it's just wishful thinking, isn't it? I don't... I don't know if everyone. . .</p>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I wanna...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I wanna see Nille again soon, but...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> But I wanna keep traveling, too!!! I don't wanna leave everyone behind!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I wanna make malanga fritters for you, Frin! And Dile still needs to teach me more Ka Buan recipes! Belle needs to finish reading me that story I like! And I still have pranks I wanna pull on Za!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Ha, no, not the pranks!!!</p>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> But... Yeah, I... It's the same for me.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I have connections with all of you I've never had with anyone else!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Even if it's just for a bit, I want to keep traveling with everyone! And after that, I want to keep in contact with everyone!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I want to know who Bonnie grows up to be. I want to hear more about what Odile thinks of Vaugardian culture. I want to see Mira open up and change even more.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> And I want to get to know you more, Sif! Talk to you more, be with you more!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I want to be with everyone for a long, long time!!!</p>

<p><b>Odile:</b> I... I never knew we all agreed on this.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> I thought I'd eventually manage to ask if some of you wanted to keep traveling for a bit...</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> It would be nice to finally travel together without worrying about the King, after all, wouldn't it? But... I never found the courage to ask...</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> And... I. . .</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> I'm having fun. Traveling with you all. Talking with you all.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> I don't... I don't want to stop traveling with everyone just yet!</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Siffrin!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> We want to stay with you, too.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> It's not just you!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> This journey won't be over yet, not if we have anything to say about it!</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> And even when it ends, it won't be the end. We'll all stay in each other's lives for a long, long time.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Yeah!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> So stop being stupid and thinking we'll forget you or whatever, because we won't, stupid Frin!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Sif!</p>

<h1 id="end">Ending</h1>
<p><i>Note: "US" is the shorthand for hatless Siffrin portraits.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(The world around you went back to normal.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You're exhausted...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Your entire body hurts.)</i></p>
<p><i>(After all those battles, after everything, walking around is all you're managing to do right now.)</i></p>
<p><i>(But you feel refreshed, too.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (surprised1):</b> So, in the end... You love us so much you wished to stay with us so hard you almost broke the world?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> That's not great, Frin.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_hnnn1):</b> "Hmrf."</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Yes, Siffrin. I had stalkers with less issues than you.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_hnnn1):</b> "Hmrnghrgh."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> I think it's nice.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (excited1):</b> I agree! Ending the world for love is what good stories are made of!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_hnnn1):</b> "Rhghhmghmmghhrm."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_sad1):</b> "...I'm sorry."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_sad2):</b> "For everything."</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Which is...?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_sad1):</b> "For saying all those things yesterday."</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really2):</b> Okay, good start.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> I think I'm speaking for everyone when I say that we forgive you, but we reserve the right to be mad about it still later!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> I won't be mad, but sure.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> I might be mad later, once someone explains to me everything that happened with easy words.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(You nod.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It'd be fine even if they don't forgive you for a bit.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (huh2):</b> ...And?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_guilty1):</b> "And for, uh, unknowingly trapping everyone in time."</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (oh!1):</b> Oh, that one's fine, isn't it?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> Yeah, we don't remember that part, so no worries here.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> I also don't understand that part.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> We'll explain everything later, Boniface.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Aaaaaaaand?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_surprised1):</b> <i>(Um...)</i> "...What else? I'm sorry..."</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (angy1):</b> Apologize for not talking to us about everything, dummy!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (stop!1):</b> Yeah, dummy! We could've helped, dummy!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> Even if I still really don't get it.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (victory1):</b> The adults could've helped, at least!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> We could have. If you had talked to us about it.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> About the loops, about how you felt, about how you wanted to keep traveling together!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_awawa1):</b> "W-Well, uh, well..."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_no!1):</b> "None of you said you wanted to keep traveling together either!!!"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Well... That's true.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> But this is YOUR apology tour. We can have one later.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Ha!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You surprise everyone by laughing.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (oh!1):</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> Heh!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Hehehe!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Everyone laughs with you.)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> ... Well, that was cute. But we need to decide what we'll do next, so...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> Uh, we'll go and escort our dear little preteen back to their sister, duh.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (and then1):</b> YEAH!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> We should go and see Nille!!! And send her a message so she knows I'm okay!!! And then I can hug her!!! And then--</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> And then we'll see, I guess. We can go and travel more after she knows I'm okay.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (Happy1):</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_happy1):</b> "Sounds good to me."</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward1b):</b> Um... Before that, though...</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> I would like to talk to her beforehand and make sure she's fine with you traveling with us, Boniface.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Otherwise, going on a journey together with you becomes a little something called a "kidnapping".</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> Very true.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> We need to make sure it's fine with her first, Bonbon!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> Hmm...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (happy1):</b> I think it'll be fine. She can come with us, right?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (proud1):</b> She always wanted to travel, but she didn't wanna do it alone and also she had to take care of me, so she'll say yes and come with us for sure!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(This sounds fun!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(You nod furiously.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (happy1):</b> Oh! That would be lovely!</p>
<p><b>Odile (yeah1):</b> That does sound fun.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha2):</b> Bonbon's sister... I'm so curious! I wanna meet her!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> And after that, we could--</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> AH!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (surprised1):</b> Wh-What--</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> THE HEAD HOUSEMAIDEN!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(AH!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (zomg):</b> OH!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (omgggg1):</b> AH!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (uwah!1):</b> OH!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>Euphrasie walks up to the group.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling4):</b> Ohohoho! Don't worry about me, everyone!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> H-Head Housemaiden! You're okay!!!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling3):</b> I am! I was staying away for a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (thankyou1):</b> You all seemed like you needed to talk, so I was patiently waiting for you all to finish your conversation!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> That's very considerate of you.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> It IS very considerate of you!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really1):</b> Sorry for forgetting about you for a sec, m'dame Head Housemaiden.</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling3):</b> Ohohoho!</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_guilty2):</b> "Also, I'm sorry for throwing you, earlier."</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (thankyou1):</b> Ohohohohohohoho!!! Do not worry!!!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling3):</b> I haven't had this much fun since reading the last issue of "The Cursing of Château Castle"!!!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (oh1):</b> I do feel awfully dizzy though. I have a wicked headache, like I've been using Crafts too much!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (sorry1):</b> Have I said anything strange?</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> You did say some weird things, yes.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (wonder2):</b> It felt like you were taken over by whatever was happening to the world...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_sad1):</b> <i>(...)</i> "You..."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_guilty2):</b> "You said the things you always say when I come and talk to you."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_guilty2):</b> "About how the world is rotting."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (US_sad1):</b> "And you can't do anything to help."</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (sorry3):</b> Hm...</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling4):</b> Interesting! I don't feel like saying it now, though!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling1):</b> Or at all! The wind feels nice and fresh.</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling4):</b> It just feels like a beautiful day, doesn't it?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (happy2):</b> It does!</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> Hm...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> Well! That's that, I guess!</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> Heh.</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (sorry1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (sorry2):</b> Traveling one... Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling2):</b> I'm sure you must have a lot to talk about with everyone.</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling1):</b> But be sure to talk to me when you're all done!</p>
<p><b>Euphrasie (smiling4):</b> So I can happily bless you and your companions' new journey!!!</p>
