<h1>Mal du Pays</h1>
<p>WIP note: reformat to new standard.</p>

<p>Dialogue for the entire battle against Mal du Pays. Raw text was provided by <b><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/skyistheground">Sky is the Ground</a></b>. Thank you very much!!!!</p>
<p>Of note: "TS" is the abbreviation used for ACT5 specific Siffrin portraits.</p>

<br>

<p>After being frozen by the King, Siffrin awakens in a pitch black void. They look around, and find nothing.</p>

<br>

<p>(. . .)</p>

<br>

<p>Siffrin walks around aimlessly in the dark.</p>

<br>

<p>(Where are you...?)</p>

<br>

<p>He continues to wander.</p>

<br>

<p>(Where is the King?)</p>

<br>

<p>They continue to wander.</p>

<br>

<p>(Where is everyone?)</p>

<br>

<p>Siffrin continues to wander, and stops. They spot a figure walking toward them. It is an inverted vision of himself.</p>

<br>

<p>(!)</p>
<p>(There's someone there...)</p>

<br>

<p>Siffrin draws their dagger. Battle begins.</p>
<p>Mal du Pays slowly comes into vision.</p>

<br>

<img src="https://instarsandtime.wiki.gg/images/6/63/ENEMY_maldupays.png" alt="Seven identical apparitions like Siffrin. Their colors are inverted, and only one stands at the front with white outlines. None have a face.">

<br>

<p>(A figure stands before you.)</p>
<p>(Is it...?)</p>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<p>Battle text now reads <b>(...)</b>.</p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 1</h2>
<p><b>Note:</b> None of Siffrin's attacks have any effect on Mal du Pays.</p>

<br>

<p>(MAL DU PAYS is silent.)</p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 2</h2>

<p>An empty textbox appears and vanishes in a flash. The name of the box said "SOMETHING".</p>

<br>

<p>(Your attacks have no effect...)</p>
<p>(But all you can do is keep attacking.)</p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 5</h2>

<p>(MAL DU PAYS watches your movements.)</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>
<p>(Why isn't it saying anything...?)</p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 8</h2>

<p>(MAL DU PAYS does not blink.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry3):</b> (...) "Hey..."</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 9</h2>

<p>(MAL DU PAYS stares at you.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (scary1):</b> (...) "Hey."

<br>

<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 11</h2>

<p>(MAL DU PAYS breathes in, and out.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (TS_angry1):</b> "HEY!!!!!!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (TS_angry2):</b> "DON'T JUST STAND HERE SILENTLY, JUDGING ME!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (TS_angry2):</b> "TALK TO ME! DON'T IGNORE ME! SAY SOMETHING!!!"</p>

<br>

<p>(The figure&ensp; opens its mouth...)</p>

<br>

<p>Siffrin's battle portrait changes to scared.</p>

<br>

<p>(and speaks.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Frin...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Frin.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Frin!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(Bonnie...?)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Frin, why...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Why did you protect me, all those times?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I...You...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You should've let me die, back then, Frin.</p>

<br>

<p>(No, no, you couldn't have, you--)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I meanâ€¦</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> It's not like you haven't let me die before, right?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Why did you protect me? I never asked for your help, Frin!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I could've been okay on my own!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I don't need you, Frin! No one does!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...But... But, Frin...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> If you had to be hurt to protect me...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Then it would've been better if you died!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You should've died! You should've died to protect me!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> It hurt so much, when the King killed me, Frin! You said you would always protect me!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You should've died for me.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You should've died to protect me.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You should've died to protect me, instead of trying to make me stronger.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> But you couldn't keep your promise.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I will never forgive you.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> <span style="font-size:larger"><i>I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!!!!!!</i></span></p>

<br>

<p><i>(!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(No, no, no, that's not...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Bonnie would never say something like this.)</i></p>
<p><i>(BONNIE WOULD NEVER SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 14</h2>

<p>(MAL DU PAYS cries silently.)</p>

<br>

<p>(The figure opens its mouth...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Siffrin...</p>

<br>

<p>(Odile's voice...?)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile:</b> ...Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> I'm disappointed in you, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> I thought you were smarter than this.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Why would you ever think we were friends?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> After all...</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Why would I be friends with someone who doesn't even remember where they're from?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Here's a philosophical conundrum for you, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> If you don't have a home to go back to, what kind of person does that make you?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> If you don't have memories of your own childhood, can you still consider yourself human?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> If you have forgotten something as important as your country, your childhood, your family, your own name, then are you even a person?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> If something is forgotten by everyone, then has that thing ever existed?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Oh, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Something as forgetful as you could never have friends.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> You forget them all, and are forgotten by them in return.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> It's strange, Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Every time I'm forced to look at you, I forget everything about you.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Your country.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Your stars and universe.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Your beliefs.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Your face.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Your name.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> It is just so easy to forget you.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> To leave you behind.</p>

<p class="dialogue-line big"><i>(NO!!!!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(No, no, no, you don't want that)</i></p>
<p><i>(You don't want to forget them)</i></p>
<p><i>(And you don't want to be forgotten!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(No!!! Odile is smart, she never forgets anything, she'd never forget you, this is just--)</i></p>
<p class="dialogue-line big"><i>(THIS ISN'T REAL!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 17</h2>

<p>(MAL DU PAYS yells silently.)</p>

<br>

<p>(The figure opens its mouth...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Sif...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b>Sif!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Isa!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Oh, Sif... I'm so glad you're here.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I can finally tell you what I've been meaning to say, all this time.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Okay.. Here it comes.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I don't understand you, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I don't understand why you're so attached to me.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I don't understand anything you say. I don't understand your jokes, your words, your very existence.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I don't want to know someone who won't even try to change, who luxuriates in things staying the exact same, like you do.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> When you're next to me, I wonder what I did to get someone so weak standing next to me.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Someone who's so afraid of everyone.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> So afraid of change.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> So afraid to be seen.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Someone who's even afraid to be touched.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Do you know why I never touch you, when we talk in front of the Favor Tree, Siffrin?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Because the idea of making skin contact with you makes me want to puke.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> And really, Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Did you think we never noticed? How you took advantage of us?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Using your loops to make your life easier? To make yourself look better?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Because it's so much easier to be loved if you know all the right answers, isn't it?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> This is the only reason I want you, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> <i>Because you made me.</i></p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Because the real you is--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting--)</i></p>
<p><i>(of course this is what he thinks, this is what you are)</i></p>
<p><i>(callous aimless manipulative)</i></p>
<p><i>(ah)</i></p>
<p><i>(your head hurts)</i></p>
<p><i>(you can't breathe)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 20</h2>

<p>(the figure opens its mouth)</p>
<p>(no please, please, please, no more)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Siffrin...</p>

<br>

<p>(mirabelle)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Oh, Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> I can't wait to never see you again.</p>

<br>

<p>The screen turns red.</p>

<br>

<p>(aaaaahhh--)</p>
<p>(The figure opens its mouth, but you strike!!!)</p>

<br>

<p>Siffrin strikes Mal du Pays, to no effect. The screen returns to monochrome.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(stop it, stop it, stop it!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(it's not real, it's not real, it's not real)</i></p>
<p><i>(none of this is real)</i></p>
