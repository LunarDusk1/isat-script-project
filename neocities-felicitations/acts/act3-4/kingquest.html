<h1 id="loop1">Start: Talk to Loop in ACT 3</h1>
<p><b>Source:</b> Map034 (Village Tree LOOP)</p>
<p><b>Location:</b> Dormont, Favor Tree</p>
<p><i>This is the first talk with Loop after beating the King for the first time. It also starts the Head Housemaiden Quest and the Friendquest storylines.</i></p>
<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You ran here to talk to Loop, to try to figure out what to do, but...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You can't look at them right now.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You can't.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> So?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide4):</b> <i>(...)</i> "...I beat the King."</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> You did?!? Oh, stars above, I'm so proud of you!!!  You did it!!! You succeeded!!! You--</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry1):</b> "And yet I'm still here."</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> ...Yes</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Indeed you are.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...They don't seem surprised.)</i></p>
<p><i>(They don't seem surprised at all, do they?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry3):</b> "Did you know this would happen?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> I had a feeling, yes.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> But it felt cruel to tell you, so I didn't.</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> You looked so...</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee5):</b> So happy and innocent and stupid!!! I just didn't have the heart to tell you!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...I just didn't have the heart to tell you.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> I knew from the start that the loops wouldn't end after defeating the King.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry1):</b> "Why not...?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> I don't know why it didn't end with beating the King.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> I just knew it wouldn't.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide4):</b> <i>(...)</i> "I..."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide4):</b> "I never thought about the reason why I got this power."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide4):</b> "I just thought... It was to beat the King."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide4):</b> "That the Change God, someone, anyone, gave me this power to beat him."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide5):</b> "But if beating him made me loop back anyway..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide5):</b> "I don't know what to do now."</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> So will you give up, then?</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You're stuck in this loop, stardust.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Beating the King brought you back here. You don't know why. You don't even know how you even got this power.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You don't know if there's even a way to escape.</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> So... Because there's no clear way to escape...</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Will you give up?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Give up...?)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(No. You're fine, aren't you?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Right now, you're alive. Right now, you can think. Right now, your allies are still here. Right now, you're not alone.)</i></p>
<p><i>(There's no reason to give up now, just because you're trapped.)</i></p>
<p><i>(If you're trapped, find a door, and open it.)</i></p>
<p><i>(And, you still have some doors to open, don't you?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry2):</b> "The Head Housemaiden seemed to know something was wrong, didn't she?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Ah... I guess she did.</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> She said something about... Something being broken? Failing?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> "Did she mean the loops?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh1):</b> The loops, breaking?</p>
<p><b>Loop (well3):</b> ...That's possible.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Maybe the loops WERE supposed to stop after beating the King, but something went wrong somehow.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(And that's something you can find out.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You just need to talk to her again. Find out what she knows.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry2):</b> "And the King..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh1):</b> The King?! What about him?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> "Something about his powers..."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry2):</b> "He can freeze people's time. And I can rewind time."</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> ...Yes, that's...</p>
<p><b>Loop (hmmm1):</b> Both powers ARE related to time, aren't they?</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> I don't think I've ever heard about anyone who could control time before...</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry2):</b> Isn't that something to find out more about?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> ...I suppose so?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> "Maybe I just need to ask him."</p>
<p><b>Loop (oh my1):</b> Ask the King?!?</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> Well, um, sure, I suppose that might work?</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> Talking to the King himself... I do wonder what he'd have to say.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> It's worth trying!</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad1):</b> ...And, stardust...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> I know you're not interested in talking to your party about the loops. If so...</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol1):</b> You'll have to make sure to act so they don't find out anything is wrong.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> And you already failed this loop by making your Housemaiden worried about you, teehee!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Ah...)</i></p>
<p><i>(It's true. With the way you woke up, she's probably worried about you, even now...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (expression_number):</b> She said she wanted to talk to you, didn't she? You should talk to her this loop, see what that's all about.</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy2):</b> Add this to your brain list of things to do.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(There's quite a few things on it already.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Find out more about the King and his powers, to see if they're related to yours.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Talk to the Head Housemaiden, to see if she knows more about the loops.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Talk to Mirabelle this loop, see what's wrong. Might as well talk to everyone else after, too.)</i></p>
<p><i>(But see?)</i></p>
<p><i>(As long as you have paths you can follow... Questions to answer...Goals to strive for...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You'll be fine.)</i></p>
<p><i>(You're fine.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(But...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Why is Loop helping you?)</i></p>
<p><i>(They appeared after you looped for the first time... And said they were here to help.)</i></p>
<p><i>(And they knew about the loops. Knew this whole time beating the King wouldn't help.)</i></p>
<p><i>(And they picked that name, didn't they? "Loop"?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Aren't they... Related to the loops, too?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> "Loop..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Hm~?</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b></p>

    <li><a href="#nothing">"Nothing."</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="really">"Are you really here to help me?"</h3>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> "Are you really here to help me?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> Stardust...</p>
<p><b>Loop (sad2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Loop (serious2):</b> If you can believe anything, believe that.</p>
<p><b>Loop (subdued1):</b> I asked to be here, so I could help you.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> "Why?"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry2):</b> "Aren't you stuck here too, just because you're helping me?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Loop (fake1):</b>  I reiterate, stardust: I asked to be here.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee1):</b> Don't worry about me.Being here is surprisingly restful!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> I'm here to help you any way I can, and I mean it!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(If they're offering their help...)</i></p>
<p><i>(It'd be stupid not to take it, isn't it?)</i></p>

<br>

<h3 id="nothing">"Nothing."</h3>

<p><i>(You don't really need to know, do you?)</i></p>
<p><i>(You don't want to start doubting them.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Loop said they're here to help you. That's all you need to know.)</i></p>

<br>

<h4>Choices reconvene</h4>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> "To answer your question, though..."</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> Hm?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (serious1):</b> "No, Loop."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry2):</b> "I won't give up."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (angry3):</b> "It's too early to give up."</p>
<p><b>Loop (well2):</b>  ...I'm very glad to hear that, stardust.</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> Please don't give up, stardust!!! If the loops started, they can end!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol6):</b> It's just basic logic. I can guarantee that you won't be stuck here forever.</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5):</b> It's a Loop Guarantee!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> And as always, you can count on me to help you!</p>
<p><b>Loop (teehee3):</b> If you need a refresher, or help figuring out where to go, I'll be here!</p>
<p><b>Loop (lol5)</b>: I'm here to help, stardust!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>This dialogue is not required to progress, but nonetheless a good start to Kingquest.</i></p>

<br>


<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "What should I do next?"

<br>

<p><b>Loop (lol4):</b> You're doing so many different things! What do you need help with?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (neutral1):</b> <i>(You need help on how to...)</i></p>
<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "...find more about the King."</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (neutral1):</b> <i>(About the King...)</i> "What should I do now?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (hm1):</b> Well... I think it's a stupid idea, but...</p>
<p><b>Loop (happy1):</b> You should go and talk to the King. Sounds like you have some questions to ask.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (surprised3):</b> "You don't agree?"</p>
<p><b>Loop (ew1):</b> He's a giant monster who might be related to the reason why you're trapped in time.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(The King...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You finally managed to beat him last time, but you still have so many questions...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Why is he freezing Vaugarde in time? Does his power have anything to do with the time loops you're stuck in?)</i></p>

<p>[You can now "Ask" the King questions by going into your Craft menu!]</p>
<p>[The things I let you do, stardust, I swear.]</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<h3 id="goal">"What's your goal?"</h3>

<p><i>This belongs to the set of three intro questions.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Oh...... My goal...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> Sif... Does it matter?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry1):</b> It doesn't!!! Your reasons don't matter at all!!!</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>Asking for the first time:</b><br> <b>Siffrin (fight3):</b> <i>(But they might!)</i></li>

<p><b>King:</b> Oooh, oooooooh...!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Can't you guess......? Can't you tell?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oh, stars...... I thought my intentions were clear...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight1):</b> We don't know! We don't understand you!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight4):</b> Why would you want to make an entire country suffer And expect everyone to be okay with it!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> There must be a reason!!! Why would you freeze Vaugarde in time!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> And only Vaugarde, for that matter?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> That's true... No other country has been attacked.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> With a power like yours, you could freeze more than just Vaugarde.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> But you stopped at the borders. Other countries are safe.  Why?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oooh, ooooooh......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Because...... Vaugarde......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Is perfect.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Perfect...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Such welcoming, creative people.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Always willing to welcome travelers in, even travelers with no name, no home to speak of......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Such...... Precious memories......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> It is perfect. I do not want it to change. I want it to stay exactly how it is.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> So it cannot ever be destroyed.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk2):</b> That's so...</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b> What backwards thinking.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight1):</b> I don't know what about Vaugarde made it perfect for you, but you cannot stop us from living!!!</p>

<br>

<h4>Asking for the first time:</h4>
<p><i>(Stars, you don't want to explain it in front of everyone...)</i></p>
<p><i>(But the King... He could be the one trapping you in time!)</i></p> 
<p><b>Siffrin (shit1):</b> "The one imprisoning me here."</p>

<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>

<br>

<p><b>Asking for the first time:</b></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(He doesn't seem to know what you're talking about.)</i></p>
<p><i>(So the King isn't the one responsible for the loops?)</i></p>

<h3 id="how">"How are you freezing people in time?"</h3>

<p><i>This belongs to the set of three intro questions.</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> ...... Ha.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Pst, Sif, could've told you that one if you asked.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm2):</b> It's Time Craft, buddy.</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>If you haven't heard about Time Craft before:</b><br> <i>(...You don't know what that is.)</i></li>
    <li><b>If you've heard about Time Craft:</b><br> <i>(Time Craft, you've heard this before...)</i></li>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> Time Craft... The ability to craft time itself.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> But Time Craft is supposed to be impossible to control...</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> How can you use it, yet alone do it as such a grand scale?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Ha...... If the bright one isn't bright enough to know of Time Craft......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> They will not be bright enough to understand how.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Ouch.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Time Craft? Like, um, specifically? I'm not sure... You should look through books about Craft. We have one here, but it might not talk about Time Craft much... I wonder... Where could you find Craftonomy books...</p>

<br>

<p><i>("Craftonomy"?)</i></p>
<p><i>(The librarian notices your confusion.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Oh, the study of Craft in general is called "Craftonomy". I don't think the libraries here or in the House carry any... Maybe you should look elsewhere?</p>

<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> Urgh, fine.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Odile flips through the book.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (reading2):</b> ...It does have a section on Time Craft.</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Alright. So, Time Craft is, as the name implies, the power to wield and craft time itself.</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh2):</b> It's a type of craft that's been hypothesized to exist for decades, but its existence has never been proven.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward2):</b> Until now, right?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> Stopping time... That's what the King does, right?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> So the King is using Time Craft?</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b> The King most likely is, yes. Which would make it the first time in history someone managed to harvest that power.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol3):</b> Outside of stories told in familytales, that is.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> I've heard scholars outside of Vaugarde are really excited right now! Time Craft, confirmed to be real!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk2):</b> ...So they're happy because he froze people in time?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> W-well, it's more complicated than that!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b> Morals aside, it does change everything we knew about Time Craft.</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Think about how Time Craft could be used. The King is only stopping people's time... But it could be used for many other things.</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading2):</b> It could be used to hasten or slow people's time, too. Maybe make people's bodies younger or older. Maybe make buds grow into trees in an instant.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huh1):</b> Worst case scenario, it could be used to change history itself! Crafting time to go back in time, and change history!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> Woah!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Woah.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (reading2):</b> The possibilities are endless... And terrifying.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (brag1):</b> Definitely not the kind of power you want in someone's hands!</p>
<p><b>Odile (hm1):</b> And definitely not someone like the King.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward2):</b> And, correct me if I'm wrong... But crafting time wouldn't be like crafting clay to a specific shape, or crafting a sword.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Those are easy enough to do and won't tire you out, but crafting time? Something as basic and essential as time?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Wouldn't it ask for immense amounts of power?</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol4):</b> Exactly. Crafting clay barely asks for any power from the user... But crafting time...</p>
<p><b>Odile (reading1):</b> It was theorized that crafting time, even to pause time for a single second... Would probably kill the user immediately.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(HUH?!?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (no!2):</b> KILL THEM DEAD?!?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fufufu1):</b> Kill them dead.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> And yet, the King is still alive...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> So it raises the question...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (sad1):</b> What gave him enough power to use Time Craft without dying? And how did he learn how to use it?</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Good questions, Isabeau. You have pretty smart insights sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaha1):</b> I sure do!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk5):</b> Hm...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (serious1):</b> Time Craft is what the King uses and it's dangerous. Got it.</p>
<p><b>Odile (serious4):</b> I suppose talking about this was useful. I'm surprised you're curious about this, though... Siffrin.</p>

<p><i>(Isn't that what you and the King have been using?)</i></p>
<p><i>(But neither of you should be able to use it... Using it would ask for immense amounts of power.)</i></p>

<p><i>(The King sobs.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> I suppose your story might be similar to mine, bright one......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> One day...... I just woke up on a beach, on a coast north of Vaugarde.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I woke up slowly, as people sometimes do, expecting to remember where I was, what I was supposed to be doing that day......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> But...... Nothing came to mind.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> And as I realized nothing came to mind, I also realized......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I could not&emsp;remember&emsp;a single&emsp;thing.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> What I was doing here on this beach, what chores I had to do on that day......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> How I got here, why I didn't recognize my surroundings......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> My past, my family, my name, the language I spoke, the alphabet I wrote with, the stars, the country's inhabitants, culture, beliefs, its very name......!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I could not remember anything!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Because all my memories, everything even slightly connected to the country I came from...... Just......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Cannot be accessed easily, anymore.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> And...... It makes sense, doesn't it?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> No one on this planet can remember our home as it was.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Most people from outside it, who had limited ties to it, only forgot the country's existence.....</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Maybe forgot a friend from there, or a distant family member......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> But for someone who had ties to it.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Who was born there, lived in it, breathed it day and night......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> There would be&emsp;nothing to remember.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> There would just be......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Emptiness.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I was cut off from my very existence.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> My entire past, my entire identity...... Erased.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......Memories make up the core of who we are, don't they?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> They're proof that we existed. That we are real.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Can you be certain of anything, if you do not remember how you learned it?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> And if you do not remember your past......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> If you only know it has been erased from your memory, because something happened to your home......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> And if SOMETHING happened, but no one remembers what, or why......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Then......</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide4):</b> "...Then, what's stopping it from happening again?"</p>
<p><b>King:</b> What if we forget it all?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (hide6):</b> "What if we lose it all, once more?"</p>

<br>

<p><i>(The King sobs.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry1):</b> "And you had to make sure it wouldn't happen again."</p>
<p><b>King:</b> At any cost necessary.</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (tired1):</b> "And if the Universe led you on this path..."</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Then it must be what the Universe wants.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> "The Universe......"</p>

<p><i>(..."Leads".)</i></p>

<p><b>King:</b> Hahahaha......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oh, oooh...... Even if you don't agree with my methods, bright one...... I can tell you understand.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> No matter what...... I could not let this happen again! I could not!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> NOT TO VAUGARDE!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> NOT TO VAUGARDIANS, WHO HOUSED ME, CARED FOR ME, LOVED ME!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I DO NOT WANT TO FORGET IT ALL, NOT AGAIN!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I WILL KEEP THE THINGS I LOVE CLOSE TO ME!!!!!! I WILL MAKE SURE THEY CAN KEEP EXISTING!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> SO THAT THEY CAN BE REMEMBERED, FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>It's the next loop, and Siffrin snaps awake in the meadow.</p>

<p><b>Loop (lol3):</b>  He's the King!!! He's probably the reason you're here, or related to it, at least!!!</p>
<p><b>Loop (angry1):</b>  And all you had to do was find out he shares your tragic backstory for you to feel pity for him. He didn't have to lift a finger!</p>
