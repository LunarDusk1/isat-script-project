<h1>Mal du Pays</h1>

<p><i>Dialogue for the entire battle against Mal du Pays. Raw text was provided by <b><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/skyistheground">Sky is the Ground</a></b>. Thank you very much!!!!</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>After being frozen by the King, Siffrin awakens in a pitch black void. They look around, and find nothing.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(. . .)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>Siffrin walks around aimlessly in the dark.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(Where are you...?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>He continues to wander.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(Where is the King?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>They continue to wander.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(Where is everyone?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>Siffrin continues to wander, and stops. They spot a figure walking toward them. It is an inverted vision of himself.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(!)</i></p>
<p><i>(There's someone there...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>Siffrin draws their dagger. Battle begins.</i></p>
<p><i>Mal du Pays slowly comes into vision.</i></p>

<br>

<img src="https://instarsandtime.wiki.gg/images/6/63/ENEMY_maldupays.png" alt="Seven identical apparitions like Siffrin. Their colors are inverted, and only one stands at the front with white outlines. None have a face.">

<br>

<p><i>(A figure stands before you.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Is it...?)</i></p>
<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>Battle text now reads <b>(...)</b>.</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 1</h2>
<p><i><b>Note:</b> None of Siffrin's attacks have any effect on Mal du Pays.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(MAL DU PAYS is silent.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 2</h2>

<p><i>An empty textbox appears and vanishes in a flash. The name of the box said "SOMETHING".</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(Your attacks have no effect...)</i></p>
<p><i>(But all you can do is keep attacking.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 5</h2>

<p><i>(MAL DU PAYS watches your movements.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Why isn't it saying anything...?)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 8</h2>

<p><i>(MAL DU PAYS does not blink.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (angry3):</b> <i>(...)</i> "Hey..."</p>

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 9</h2>

<p><i>(MAL DU PAYS stares at you.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (scary1):</b> <i>(...)</i> "Hey."

<br>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 11</h2>

<p><i>(MAL DU PAYS breathes in, and out.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (TS_angry1):</b> "HEY!!!!!!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (TS_angry2):</b> "DON'T JUST STAND HERE SILENTLY, JUDGING ME!"</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (TS_angry2):</b> "TALK TO ME! DON'T IGNORE ME! SAY SOMETHING!!!"</p>

<br>

<p><i>(The figure&ensp; opens its mouth...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>Siffrin's battle portrait changes to scared.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(and speaks.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Frin...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Frin.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Frin!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Bonnie...?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Frin, why...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Why did you protect me, all those times?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I...You...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You should've let me die, back then, Frin.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(No, no, you couldn't have, you--)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I meanâ€¦</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> It's not like you haven't let me die before, right?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Why did you protect me? I never asked for your help, Frin!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I could've been okay on my own!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I don't need you, Frin! No one does!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> ...But... But, Frin...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> If you had to be hurt to protect me...</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> Then it would've been better if you died!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You should've died! You should've died to protect me!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> It hurt so much, when the King killed me, Frin! You said you would always protect me!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You should've died for me.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You should've died to protect me.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> You should've died to protect me, instead of trying to make me stronger.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> But you couldn't keep your promise.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I will never forgive you.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie:</b> I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(No, no, no, that's not...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Bonnie would never say something like this.)</i></p>
<p><i>(BONNIE WOULD NEVER SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 14</h2>

<p><i>(MAL DU PAYS cries silently.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(The figure opens its mouth...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile:</b> Siffrin...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Odile's voice...?)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile:</b> ...Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> I'm disappointed in you, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> I thought you were smarter than this.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Why would you ever think we were friends?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> After all...</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Why would I be friends with someone who doesn't even remember where they're from?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Here's a philosophical conundrum for you, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> If you don't have a home to go back to, what kind of person does that make you?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> If you don't have memories of your own childhood, can you still consider yourself human?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> If you have forgotten something as important as your country, your childhood, your family, your own name, then are you even a person?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> If something is forgotten by everyone, then has that thing ever existed?</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Oh, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Something as forgetful as you could never have friends.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> You forget them all, and are forgotten by them in return.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> It's strange, Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Every time I'm forced to look at you, I forget everything about you.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Your country.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Your stars and universe.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Your beliefs.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Your face.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> Your name.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> It is just so easy to forget you.</p>
<p><b>Odile:</b> To leave you behind.</p>

<p><i>(NO!!!!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(No, no, no, you don't want that)</i></p>
<p><i>(You don't want to forget them)</i></p>
<p><i>(And you don't want to be forgotten!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(No!!! Odile is smart, she never forgets anything, she'd never forget you, this is just--)</i></p>
<p><i>(THIS ISN'T REAL!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 17</h2>

<p><i>(MAL DU PAYS yells silently.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(The figure opens its mouth...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Sif...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b>Sif!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Isa!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Oh, Sif... I'm so glad you're here.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I can finally tell you what I've been meaning to say, all this time.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Okay.. Here it comes.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I don't understand you, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I don't understand why you're so attached to me.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I don't understand anything you say. I don't understand your jokes, your words, your very existence.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> I don't want to know someone who won't even try to change, who luxuriates in things staying the exact same, like you do.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> When you're next to me, I wonder what I did to get someone so weak standing next to me.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Someone who's so afraid of everyone.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> So afraid of change.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> So afraid to be seen.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Someone who's even afraid to be touched.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Do you know why I never touch you, when we talk in front of the Favor Tree, Siffrin?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Because the idea of making skin contact with you makes me want to puke.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> And really, Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Did you think we never noticed? How you took advantage of us?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Using your loops to make your life easier? To make yourself look better?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Because it's so much easier to be loved if you know all the right answers, isn't it?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> This is the only reason I want you, Siffrin.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Because you made me.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau:</b> Because the real you is--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting--)</i></p>
<p><i>(of course this is what he thinks, this is what you are)</i></p>
<p><i>(callous aimless manipulative)</i></p>
<p><i>(ah)</i></p>
<p><i>(your head hurts)</i></p>
<p><i>(you can't breathe)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Turn 20</h2>

<p><i>(the figure opens its mouth)</i></p>
<p><i>(no please, please, please, no more)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Siffrin...</p>

<br>

<p><i>(mirabelle)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> Oh, Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle:</b> I can't wait to never see you again.</p>

<br>

<p><i>The screen turns red.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(aaaaahhh--)</i></p>
<p><i>(The figure opens its mouth, but you strike!!!)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>Siffrin strikes Mal du Pays, to no effect. The screen returns to monochrome.</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(stop it, stop it, stop it!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(it's not real, it's not real, it's not real)</i></p>
<p><i>(none of this is real)</i></p>
<p><i>(you just need to wake up!!!)</i></p>
<p><i>(wake up)</i></p>
<p><i>(wake up)</i></p>
<p><i>(wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up)</i></p>
