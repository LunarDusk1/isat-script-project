<h3>ACT 1 & 2</h3>
<p><i>(Some papers.)</i></p>
<p><i>(There's some sort of sale happening, it seems.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3>ACT 3 onwards</h3>
<p><i>(Some papers.)</i></p>

<h1 id="shopkeep">Shopkeeper</h1>

<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Ahoy, traveling one!</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Oh! You're with Mirabelle and the lady with the glasses, I recognize you!</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Can you believe Mirabelle has been blessed by the Change God to save us all?</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> The Change God almost never gives blessings of any kind... It's truly amazing Mirabelle has been chosen!</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> May the Change God protect her in her journey!!!</p>

<br>

<h2>First interaction</h2>
<p><i>(You nod.)</i></p>
<p><i>(The Change God, huh...)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Second interaction, ACT 2 only</h2>
<p><i>(You nod, again.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Blessings by the Change God, huh...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You wonder if the Change God is the one who revived you, and gave you those powers.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Eh, it doesn't matter that much.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>First interaction in ACT 3</h2>

<p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i> (But Mirabelle wasn't blessed by the Change God. She was blessed by the Head Housemaiden.)</i></p>
<p><i>(It doesn't make that much of a difference to you, but Mirabelle seemed very worried at the idea of people knowing, so much that she kept the truth a secret...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Probably Mirabelle getting stressed out for nothing.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#mirano">"How would you react if she wasn't actually blessed by the Change God?"</a></li>
    <li><a href="#nah"><i>(Nah.)</i></a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mirano">"How would you react if she wasn't actually blessed by the Change God?"</h3>

<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> ...</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Huh? What do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> If... If she wasn't blessed by the Change God, then...</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Then it would mean the Change God abandoned us, right? It would mean there's no hope for Vaugarde, right? Hahaha...</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> ...Where is this coming from, anyway? You said this hypothetically, right? She's really blessed by the Change God, right?</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> VAUGARDE WILL BE SAVED, RIGHT?!?</p>

<br>

<p><i>(. . .)</i></p>
<p><i>(Ah, you get it now.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "Hypothetically, of course!"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Oh, okay! Phew! You had me worried for a second, there!!!</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Ah, what a relief.</p>

<br>

<p><i>(. . .)</i></p>
<p><i>(You understand Mirabelle a bit better, now.)</i></p>

<br>

<h3 id="nah">(Nah.)</h3>

<p><i>(None of your business.)</i></p>

<br>

<h2>If you found the locked Storage Room</h2>

<p><b>Siffrin (questions1):</b> <i>(Oh, before you forget.)</i> "Know anything about locked doors in  the House?"</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Locked doors...? Ah, yes!</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> There's one locked by one of those word locks. Let's see...</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Ah, I remember! The openphrase to open it is "stostorage roomoom", because there's a storage room inside, but I didn't want it to unlock if you just said "storage room".</p>

<br>

<p><i>(. . .)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> D-Don't look at me like that...</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Well, either way, there's not much in there. Nonetheless, I hope it helps you on your journey tomorrow!</p>

<br>

<h2>ACT 3, if you have not found the <a href="/rooms/floor3/secret_room.html">Secret Room</a>.</h2>

<p><i>(Hm...)</i></p>
<p><i>(Didn't this shopkeeper know about that one locked room?)</i></p>
<p><i>(Maybe they'd know about other, secret, hidden rooms around the House.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Nothing else to do but explore, you suppose.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (questions1):</b> "Know of any hidden rooms in the House?"</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Hm... Hidden rooms, hidden rooms...</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Oh! It's not really hidden, but... You might see a bunch of holes in walls. And rubble around them, too.</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Honestly, we've been trying to fix those... Some are water damage, some are accidents, some are, uh, scientific explosions.</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> But I have heard one of those holes actually leads to some old, blocked off hallway!</p>

<br>

<p><i>(Hm...)</i></p>
<p><i>(You should keep a lookout for holes in walls, and rubble, you suppose.)</i></p>

<h2>ACT 4, once you need to ask for wishes</h2>

<p><i>(You need to ask...)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> What I asked the Favor Tree?</p>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> For the Change God to keep protecting Vaugarde, of course!</p>

<br>


<h2>ACT 5</h2>

<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Ahoy, tra--</p>

<br>

<p><i>(No point talking to them.)</i></p>

<p><b>If you haven't talked to Odile yet:</b></p>
<p><i>(You're only in here to talk to Odile, anyway.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><i>(You walk away.)</i></p>

<br>

<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> Oh, um, okay! May the Change God protect you!</p>
<p><b>Odile (up1):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<h2>Repeated interaction</h2>
<p><b>Story-loving Shopkeeper:</b> May the Change God protect you!</p>
